    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      This book has grown out of a series of articles contributed to &ldquo;The
      Saturday Review&rdquo; some ten or twelve years ago. As they appeared they were
      talked of and criticized in the usual way; a minority of readers thought
      &ldquo;the stuff&rdquo; interesting; many held that my view of Shakespeare was purely
      arbitrary; others said I had used a concordance to such purpose that out
      of the mass of words I had managed, by virtue of some unknown formula, to
      re-create the character of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is much simpler: I read Shakespeare's plays in boyhood, chiefly
      for the stories; every few years later I was fain to re-read them; for as
      I grew I always found new beauties in them which I had formerly missed,
      and again and again I was lured back by tantalizing hints and suggestions
      of a certain unity underlying the diversity of characters. These
      suggestions gradually became more definite till at length, out of the
      myriad voices in the plays, I began to hear more and more insistent the
      accents of one voice, and out of the crowd of faces, began to distinguish
      more and more clearly the features of the writer; for all the world like
      some lovelorn girl, who, gazing with her soul in her eyes, finds in the
      witch's cauldron the face of the belovèd.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have tried in this book to trace the way I followed, step by step; for I
      found it effective to rough in the chief features of the man first, and
      afterwards, taking the plays in succession, to show how Shakespeare
      painted himself at full-length not once, but twenty times, at as many
      different periods of his life. This is one reason why he is more
      interesting to us than the greatest men of the past, than Dante even, or
      Homer; for Dante and Homer worked only at their best in the flower of
      manhood. Shakespeare, on the other hand, has painted himself for us in his
      green youth with hardly any knowledge of life or art, and then in his
      eventful maturity, with growing experience and new powers, in masterpiece
      after masterpiece; and at length in his decline with weakened grasp and
      fading colours, so that in him we can study the growth and fruiting and
      decay of the finest spirit that has yet been born among men. This tragedy
      of tragedies, in which &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; is only one scene&mdash;this rise to
      intensest life and widest vision and fall through abysms of despair and
      madness to exhaustion and death&mdash;can be followed experience by
      experience, from Stratford to London and its thirty years of passionate
      living, and then from London to village Stratford again, and the eternal
      shrouding silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as this astonishing drama discovered itself to me in its tragic
      completeness I jumped to the conclusion that it must have been set forth
      long ago in detail by Shakespeare's commentators, and so, for the first
      time, I turned to their works. I do not wish to rail at my forerunners as
      Carlyle railed at the historians of Cromwell, or I should talk, as he
      talked, about &ldquo;libraries of inanities...conceited dilettantism and
      pedantry...prurient stupidity,&rdquo; and so forth. The fact is, I found all
      this, and worse; I waded through tons of talk to no result. Without a
      single exception the commentators have all missed the man and the story;
      they have turned the poet into a tradesman, and the unimaginable tragedy
      of his life into the commonplace record of a successful tradesman's
      career. Even to explain this astounding misadventure of the host of
      critics is a little difficult. The mistake, of course, arose from the fact
      that his contemporaries told very little about Shakespeare; they left his
      appearance and even the incidents of his life rather vague. Being without
      a guide, and having no clear idea of Shakespeare's character, the critics
      created him in their own image, and, whenever they were in doubt,
      idealized him according to the national type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, there was at least one exception. Some Frenchman, I think it is
      Joubert, says that no great man is born into the world without another man
      being born about the same time, who understands and can interpret him, and
      Shakespeare was of necessity singularly fortunate in his interpreter. Ben
      Jonson was big enough to see him fairly, and to give excellent-true
      testimony concerning him. Jonson's view of Shakespeare is astonishingly
      accurate and trustworthy so far as it goes; even his attitude of
      superiority to Shakespeare is fraught with meaning. Two hundred years
      later, the rising tide of international criticism produced two men, Goethe
      and Coleridge, who also saw Shakespeare, if only by glimpses, or rather by
      divination of kindred genius, recognizing certain indubitable traits.
      Goethe's criticism of &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; has been vastly over-praised; but now and
      then he used words about Shakespeare which, in due course, we shall see
      were illuminating words, the words of one who guessed something of the
      truth. Coleridge, too, with his curious, complex endowment of philosopher
      and poet, resembled Shakespeare, saw him, therefore, by flashes, and might
      have written greatly about him; but, alas, Coleridge, a Puritan born, was
      brought up in epicene hypocrisies, and determined to see Shakespeare&mdash;that
      child of the Renascence&mdash;as a Puritan, too, and consequently mis-saw
      him far oftener than he saw him; misjudged him hideously, and had no
      inkling of his tragic history.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a famous passage in Coleridge's &ldquo;Essays on Shakespeare&rdquo; which
      illustrates what I mean. It begins: &ldquo;In Shakespeare all the elements of
      womanhood are holy&rdquo;; and goes on to eulogize the instinct of chastity
      which all his women possess, and this in spite of Doll Tearsheet, Tamora,
      Cressida, Goneril, Regan, Cleopatra, the Dark Lady of the Sonnets, and
      many other frail and fascinating figures. Yet whatever gleam of light has
      fallen on Shakespeare since Coleridge's day has come chiefly from that
      dark lantern which he now and then flashed upon the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one solitary respect, our latter-day criticism has been successful; it
      has established with very considerable accuracy the chronology of the
      plays, and so the life-story of the poet is set forth in due order for
      those to read who can.
    </p>
    <p>
      This then is what I found&mdash;a host of commentators who saw men as
      trees walking, and mistook plain facts, and among them one authentic
      witness, Jonson, and two interesting though not trustworthy witnesses,
      Goethe and Coleridge&mdash;and nothing more in three centuries. The mere
      fact may well give us pause, pointing as it does to a truth which is still
      insufficiently understood. It is the puzzle of criticism, at once the
      despair and wonder of readers, that the greatest men of letters usually
      pass through life without being remarked or understood by their
      contemporaries. The men of Elizabeth's time were more interested in Jonson
      than in Shakespeare, and have told us much more about the younger than the
      greater master; just as Spaniards of the same age were more interested in
      Lope de Vega than in Cervantes, and have left a better picture of the
      second-rate playwright than of the world-poet. Attempting to solve this
      problem Emerson coolly assumed that the men of the Elizabethan age were so
      great that Shakespeare himself walked about among them unnoticed as a
      giant among giants. This reading of the riddle is purely transcendental.
      We know that Shakespeare's worst plays were far oftener acted than his
      best; that &ldquo;Titus Andronicus&rdquo; by popular favour was more esteemed than
      &ldquo;Hamlet.&rdquo; The majority of contemporary poets and critics regarded
      Shakespeare rather as a singer of &ldquo;sugred&rdquo; verses than as a dramatist. The
      truth is that Shakespeare passed through life unnoticed because he was so
      much greater than his contemporaries that they could not see him at all in
      his true proportions. It was Jonson, the nearest to him in greatness, who
      alone saw him at all fairly and appreciated his astonishing genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing illustrates more perfectly the unconscious wisdom of the English
      race than the old saying that &ldquo;a man must be judged by his peers.&rdquo; One's
      peers, in fact, are the only persons capable of judging one, and the truth
      seems to be that three centuries have only produced three men at all
      capable of judging Shakespeare. The jury is still being collected. But
      from the quality of the first three, and of their praise, it is already
      plain that his place will be among the highest. From various indications,
      too, it looks as if the time for judging him had come: &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; is perhaps
      his most characteristic creation, and Hamlet, in his intellectual unrest,
      morbid brooding, cynical self-analysis and dislike of bloodshed, is much
      more typical of the nineteenth or twentieth century than of the sixteenth.
      Evidently the time for classifying the creator of Hamlet is at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this work of description and classification should be done as a
      scientist would do it: for criticism itself has at length bent to the
      Time-spirit and become scientific. And just as in science, analysis for
      the moment has yielded pride of place to synthesis, so the critical
      movement in literature has in our time become creative. The chemist, who
      resolves any substance into its elements, is not satisfied till by
      synthesis he can re-create the substance out of its elements: this is the
      final proof that his knowledge is complete. And so we care little or
      nothing to-day for critical analyses or appreciations which are not
      creative presentments of the person. &ldquo;Paint him for us,&rdquo; we say, &ldquo;in his
      habit as he lived, and we will take it that you know something about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the chief attempts at creative criticism in English literature, or,
      perhaps it would be fairer to say, the only memorable attempt, is
      Carlyle's Cromwell. He has managed to build up the man for us quite
      credibly out of Cromwell's letters and speeches, showing us the underlying
      sincerity and passionate resolution of the great Puritan once for all. But
      unfortunately Carlyle was too romantic an artist, too persuaded in his
      hero-worship to discover for us Cromwell's faults and failings. In his
      book we find nothing of the fanatic who ordered the Irish massacres,
      nothing of the neuropath who lived in hourly dread of assassination.
      Carlyle has painted his subject all in lights, so to speak; the shadows
      are not even indicated, and yet he ought to have known that in proportion
      to the brilliancy of the light the shadows must of necessity be dark. It
      is not for me to point out that this romantic painting of great men, like
      all other make-believes and hypocrisies, has its drawbacks and
      shortcomings: it is enough that it has had its day and produced its
      pictures of giant-heroes and their worshippers for those who love such
      childish toys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonderful age in which we live&mdash;this twentieth century with its
      X-rays that enable us to see through the skin and flesh of men, and to
      study the working of their organs and muscles and nerves&mdash;has brought
      a new spirit into the world, a spirit of fidelity to fact, and with it a
      new and higher ideal of life and of art, which must of necessity change
      and transform all the conditions of existence, and in time modify the
      almost immutable nature of man. For this new spirit, this love of the fact
      and of truth, this passion for reality will do away with the foolish fears
      and futile hopes which have fretted the childhood of our race, and will
      slowly but surely establish on broad foundations the Kingdom of Man upon
      Earth. For that is the meaning and purpose of the change which is now
      coming over the world. The faiths and convictions of twenty centuries are
      passing away and the forms and institutions of a hundred generations of
      men are dissolving before us like the baseless fabric of a dream. A new
      morality is already shaping itself in the spirit; a morality based not on
      guess-work and on fancies; but on ascertained laws of moral health; a
      scientific morality belonging not to statics, like the morality of the
      Jews, but to dynamics, and so fitting the nature of each individual
      person. Even now conscience with its prohibitions is fading out of life,
      evolving into a more profound consciousness of ourselves and others, with
      multiplied incitements to wise giving. The old religious asceticism with
      its hatred of the body is dead; the servile acceptance of conditions of
      life and even of natural laws is seen to be vicious; it is of the nobility
      of man to be insatiate in desire and to rebel against limiting conditions;
      it is the property of his intelligence to constrain even the laws of
      nature to the attainment of his ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already we are proud of being students, investigators, servants of truth,
      and we leave the great names of demi-gods and heroes a little
      contemptuously to the men of bygone times. As student-artists we are no
      longer content with the outward presentment and form of men: we want to
      discover the protean vanities, greeds and aspirations of men, and to lay
      bare, as with a scalpel, the hidden motives and springs of action. We
      dream of an art that shall take into account the natural daily decay and
      up-building of cell-life; the wars that go on in the blood; the fevers of
      the brain; the creeping paralysis of nerve-exhaustion; above all, we must
      be able even now from a few bare facts, to re-create a man and make him
      live and love again for the reader, just as the biologist from a few
      scattered bones can reconstruct some prehistoric bird or fish or mammal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we student-artists have no desire to paint our subject as better or
      nobler or smaller or meaner than he was in reality; we study his
      limitations as we study his gifts, his virtues with as keen an interest as
      his vices; for it is in some excess of desire, or in some extravagance of
      mentality, that we look for the secret of his achievement, just as we
      begin to wonder when we see hands constantly outstretched in pious
      supplication, whether a foot is not thrust out behind in some secret
      shame, for the biped, man, must keep a balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I intend first of all to prove from Shakespeare's works that he has
      painted himself twenty times from youth till age at full length: I shall
      consider and compare these portraits till the outlines of his character
      are clear and certain; afterwards I shall show how his little vanities and
      shames idealized the picture, and so present him as he really was, with
      his imperial intellect and small snobberies; his giant vices and paltry
      self-deceptions; his sweet gentleness and long martyrdom. I cannot but
      think that his portrait will thus gain more in truth than it can lose in
      ideal beauty. Or let me come nearer to my purpose by means of a simile.
      Talking with Sir David Gill one evening on shipboard about the fixed
      stars, he pointed one out which is so distant that we cannot measure how
      far it is away from us and can form no idea of its magnitude. &ldquo;But
      surely,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;the great modern telescopes must bring the star
      nearer and magnify it?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;no; the best instruments make
      the star clearer to us, but certainly not larger.&rdquo; This is what I wish to
      do in regard to Shakespeare; make him clearer to men, even if I do not
      make him larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if I were asked why I do this, why I take the trouble to re-create a
      man now three centuries dead, it is first of all, of course, because he is
      worth it&mdash;the most complex and passionate personality in the world,
      whether of life or letters&mdash;because, too, there are certain lessons
      which the English will learn from Shakespeare more quickly and easily than
      from any living man, and a little because I want to get rid of Shakespeare
      by assimilating all that was fine in him, while giving all that was common
      and vicious in him as spoil to oblivion. He is like the Old-Man-of-the-Sea
      on the shoulders of our youth; he has become an obsession to the critic, a
      weapon to the pedant, a nuisance to the man of genius. True, he has
      painted great pictures in a superb, romantic fashion; he is the Titian of
      dramatic art: but is there to be no Rembrandt, no Balzac, no greater
      Tolstoi in English letters? I want to liberate Englishmen so far as I can
      from the tyranny of Shakespeare's greatness. For the new time is upon us,
      with its new knowledge and new claims, and we English are all too willing
      to live in the past, and so lose our inherited place as leader of the
      nations.

      The French have profited by their glorious Revolution: they trusted reason
      and have had their reward; no such leap forward has ever been made as
      France made in that one decade, and the effects are still potent. In the
      last hundred years the language of Molière has grown fourfold; the slang
      of the studios and the gutter and the laboratory, of the engineering
      school and the dissecting table, has been ransacked for special terms to
      enrich and strengthen the language in order that it may deal easily with
      the new thoughts. French is now a superb instrument, while English is
      positively poorer than it was in the time of Shakespeare, thanks to the
      prudery of our illiterate middle class. Divorced from reality, with its
      activities all fettered in baby-linen, our literature has atrophied and
      dwindled into a babble of nursery rhymes, tragedies of Little Marys, tales
      of Babes in a Wood. The example of Shakespeare may yet teach us the value
      of free speech; he could say what he liked as he liked: he was not afraid
      of the naked truth and the naked word, and through his greatness a Low
      Dutch dialect has become the chiefest instrument of civilization, the
      world-speech of humanity at large.

      CHAPTER I. HAMLET: ROMEO&mdash;JAQUES
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I passed by ... I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN
      GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.&rdquo; This
      work of Paul&mdash;the discovery and proclaiming of an unknown god&mdash;is
      in every age the main function of the critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unknown god this Shakespeare of ours, whom all are agreed it would be
      well to know, if in any way possible. As to the possibility, however, the
      authorities are at loggerheads. Hallam, &ldquo;the judicious,&rdquo; declared that it
      was impossible to learn anything certain about &ldquo;the man, Shakespeare.&rdquo;
       Wordsworth, on the other hand (without a nickname to show a close
      connection with the common), held that Shakespeare unlocked his heart with
      the sonnets for key. Browning jeered at this belief, to be in turn
      contradicted by Swinburne. Matthew Arnold gave us in a sonnet &ldquo;the best
      opinion of his time&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Others abide our question. Thou art free.
  We ask and ask&mdash;Thou smilest and art still,
  Out-topping knowledge.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But alas! the best opinion of one generation is in these matters often
      flat unreason to the next, and it may be that in this instance neither the
      opinion of Hallam nor Browning nor Arnold will be allowed to count.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it is the object of a general to win battles so it is the life-work of
      the artist to show himself to us, and the completeness with which he
      reveals his own individuality is perhaps the best measure of his genius.
      One does this like Montaigne, simply, garrulously, telling us his height
      and make, his tastes and distastes, his loves and fears and habits, till
      gradually the seeming-artless talk brings the man before us, a sun-warmed
      fruit of humanity, with uncouth rind of stiff manners and sweet kindly
      juices, not perfect in any way, shrivelled on this side by early
      frost-bite, and on that softened to corruption through too much heat,
      marred here by the bitter-black cicatrice of an ancient injury and there
      fortune-spotted, but on the whole healthy, grateful, of a most pleasant
      ripeness. Another, like Shakespeare, with passionate conflicting
      sympathies and curious impartial intellect cannot discover himself so
      simply; needs, like the diamond, many facets to show all the light in him,
      and so proceeds to cut them one after the other as Falstaff or Hamlet, to
      the dazzling of the purblind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Shakespeare's purpose is surely the same as Montaigne's, to reveal
      himself to us, and it would be hasty to decide that his skill is inferior.
      For while Montaigne had nothing but prose at his command, and not too rich
      a prose, as he himself complains, Shakespeare in magic of expression has
      had no equal in recorded time, and he used the lyric as well as the
      dramatic form, poetry as well as prose, to give his soul utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are doing Shakespeare wrong by trying to believe that he hides himself
      behind his work; the suspicion is as unworthy as the old suspicion
      dissipated by Carlyle that Cromwell was an ambitious hypocrite. Sincerity
      is the birthmark of genius, and we can be sure that Shakespeare has
      depicted himself for us with singular fidelity; we can see him in his
      works, if we will take the trouble, &ldquo;in his habit as he lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We are doing ourselves wrong, too, by pretending that Shakespeare
      &ldquo;out-tops knowledge.&rdquo; He did not fill the world even in his own time:
      there was room beside him in the days of Elizabeth for Marlowe and
      Spenser, Ben Jonson and Bacon, and since then the spiritual outlook, like
      the material outlook, has widened to infinity. There is space in life now
      for a dozen ideals undreamed-of in the sixteenth century. Let us have done
      with this pretence of doglike humility; we, too, are men, and there is on
      earth no higher title, and in the universe nothing beyond our
      comprehending. It will be well for us to know Shakespeare and all his high
      qualities and do him reverence; it will be well for us, too, to see his
      limitations and his faults, for after all it is the human frailties in a
      man that call forth our sympathy and endear him to us, and without love
      there is no virtue in worship, no attraction in example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doubt as to the personality of Shakespeare, and the subsequent
      confusion and contradictions are in the main, I think, due to Coleridge.
      He was the first modern critic to have glimpses of the real Shakespeare,
      and the vision lent his words a singular authority. But Coleridge was a
      hero-worshipper by nature and carried reverence to lyric heights. He used
      all his powers to persuade men that Shakespeare was {Greek: <i>myrionous
      anaer</i>}&mdash;&ldquo;the myriad-minded man&rdquo;; a sort of demi-god who was every
      one and no one, a Proteus without individuality of his own. The theory has
      held the field for nearly a century, probably because it flatters our
      national vanity; for in itself it is fantastically absurd and leads to
      most ridiculous conclusions. For instance, when Coleridge had to deal with
      the fact that Shakespeare never drew a miser, instead of accepting the
      omission as characteristic, for it is confirmed by Ben Jonson's testimony
      that he was &ldquo;of an open and free nature,&rdquo; Coleridge proceeded to argue
      that avarice is not a permanent passion in humanity, and that Shakespeare
      probably for that reason chose to leave it undescribed. This is an example
      of the ecstasy of hero-worship; it is begging the question to assume that
      whatever Shakespeare did was perfect; humanity cannot be penned up even in
      Shakespeare's brain. Like every other man of genius Shakespeare must have
      shown himself in his qualities and defects, in his preferences and
      prejudices; &ldquo;a fallible being,&rdquo; as stout old Dr. Johnson knew, &ldquo;will fail
      somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even had Shakespeare tried to hide himself in his work, he could not have
      succeeded. Now that the print of a man's hand or foot or ear is enough to
      distinguish him from all other men, it is impossible to believe that the
      mask of his mind, the very imprint, form and pressure of his soul should
      be less distinctive. Just as Monsieur Bertillon's whorl-pictures of a
      thumb afford overwhelming proofs of a man's identity, so it is possible
      from Shakespeare's writings to establish beyond doubt the main features of
      his character and the chief incidents of his life. The time for random
      assertion about Shakespeare and unlimited eulogy of him has passed away
      for ever: the object of this inquiry is to show him as he lived and loved
      and suffered, and the proofs of this and of that trait shall be so heaped
      up as to stifle doubt and reach absolute conviction. For not only is the
      circumstantial evidence overwhelming and conclusive, but we have also the
      testimony of eye-witnesses with which to confirm it, and one of these
      witnesses, Ben Jonson, is of rare credibility and singularly well
      equipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us begin, then, by treating Shakespeare as we would treat any other
      writer, and ask simply how a dramatic author is most apt to reveal
      himself. A great dramatist may not paint himself for us at any time in his
      career with all his faults and vices; but when he goes deepest into human
      nature, we may be sure that self-knowledge is his guide; as Hamlet said,
      &ldquo;To know a man well, were to know himself&rdquo; (oneself), so far justifying
      the paradox that dramatic writing is merely a form of autobiography. We
      may take then as a guide this first criterion that, in his masterpiece of
      psychology, the dramatist will reveal most of his own nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a dozen lovers of Shakespeare were asked to name the most profound and
      most complex character in all his dramas it is probable that every one
      without hesitation would answer Hamlet. The current of cultivated opinion
      has long set in this direction. With the intuition of a kindred genius,
      Goethe was the first to put Hamlet on a pedestal: &ldquo;the incomparable,&rdquo; he
      called him, and devoted pages to an analysis of the character. Coleridge
      followed with the confession whose truth we shall see later: &ldquo;I have a
      smack of Hamlet myself, if I may say so.&rdquo; But even if it be admitted that
      Hamlet is the most complex and profound of Shakespeare's creations, and
      therefore probably the character in which Shakespeare revealed most of
      himself, the question of degree still remains to be determined. Is it
      possible to show certainly that even the broad outlines of Hamlet's
      character are those of the master-poet?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various ways in which this might be proved. For instance, if one
      could show that whenever Shakespeare fell out of a character he was
      drawing, he unconsciously dropped into the Hamlet vein, one's suspicion as
      to the identity of Hamlet and the poet would be enormously strengthened.
      There is another piece of evidence still more convincing. Suppose that
      Shakespeare in painting another character did nothing but paint Hamlet
      over again trait by trait&mdash;virtue by virtue, fault by fault&mdash;our
      assurance would be almost complete; for a dramatist only makes this
      mistake when he is speaking unconsciously in his proper person. But if
      both these kinds of proof were forthcoming, and not once but a dozen
      times, then surely our conviction as to the essential identity of Hamlet
      and Shakespeare would amount to practical certitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it would be foolish, even in this event, to pretend that Hamlet
      exhausts Shakespeare; art does little more than embroider the fringe of
      the garment of life, and the most complex character in drama or even in
      fiction is simple indeed when compared with even the simplest of living
      men or women. Shakespeare included in himself Falstaff and Cleopatra,
      beside the author of the sonnets, and knowledge drawn from all these must
      be used to fill out and perhaps to modify the outlines given in Hamlet
      before one can feel sure that the portrait is a re-presentment of reality.
      But when this study is completed, it will be seen that with many necessary
      limitations, Hamlet is indeed a revelation of some of the most
      characteristic traits of Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      To come to the point quickly, I will take Hamlet's character as analyzed
      by Coleridge and Professor Dowden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coleridge says: &ldquo;Hamlet's character is the prevalence of the abstracting
      and generalizing habit over the practical. He does not want courage,
      skill, will or opportunity; but every incident sets him thinking: and it
      is curious, and at the same time strictly natural, that Hamlet, who all
      the play seems reason itself, should be impelled at last by mere accident
      to effect his object.&rdquo; Again he says: &ldquo;in Hamlet we see a great, an almost
      enormous intellectual activity and a proportionate aversion to real action
      consequent upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Professor Dowden's analysis is more careful but hardly as complete. He
      calls Hamlet &ldquo;the meditative son&rdquo; of a strong-willed father, and adds, &ldquo;he
      has slipped on into years of full manhood still a haunter of the
      university, a student of philosophies, an amateur in art, a ponderer on
      the things of life and death who has never formed a resolution or executed
      a deed. This long course of thinking apart from action has destroyed
      Hamlet's very capacity for belief.... In presence of the spirit he is
      himself 'a spirit,' and believes in the immortality of the soul. When left
      to his private thoughts he wavers uncertainly to and fro; death is a
      sleep; a sleep, it may be, troubled with dreams.... He is incapable of
      certitude.... After his fashion (that of one who relieves himself by
      speech rather than by deeds) he unpacks his heart in words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now what other personage is there in Shakespeare who shows these traits or
      some of them? He should be bookish and irresolute, a lover of thought and
      not of action, of melancholy temper too, and prone to unpack his heart
      with words. Almost every one who has followed the argument thus far will
      be inclined to think of Romeo. Hazlitt declared that &ldquo;Romeo is Hamlet in
      love. There is the same rich exuberance of passion and sentiment in the
      one, that there is of thought and sentiment in the other. Both are absent
      and self-involved; both live out of themselves in a world of imagination.&rdquo;
       Much of this is true and affords a noteworthy example of Hazlitt's
      occasional insight into character, yet for reasons that will appear later
      it is not possible to insist, as Hazlitt does, upon the identity of Romeo
      and Hamlet. The most that can be said is that Romeo is a younger brother
      of Hamlet, whose character is much less mature and less complex than that
      of the student-prince. Moreover, the characterization in Romeo&mdash;the
      mere drawing and painting&mdash;is very inferior to that put to use in
      Hamlet. Romeo is half hidden from us in the rose-mist of passion, and
      after he is banished from Juliet's arms we only see him for a moment as he
      rushes madly by into never-ending night, and all the while Shakespeare is
      thinking more of the poetry of the theme than of his hero's character.
      Romeo is crude and immature when compared with a profound psychological
      study like Hamlet. In &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; the action often stands still while
      incidents are invented for the mere purpose of displaying the
      peculiarities of the protagonist. &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; too, is the longest of
      Shakespeare's plays with the exception of &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
      total length of Hamlet's speeches,&rdquo; says Dryasdust, &ldquo;far exceeds that of
      those allotted by Shakespeare to any other of his characters.&rdquo; The
      important point, however, is that Romeo has a more than family likeness to
      Hamlet. Even in the heat and heyday of his passion Romeo plays thinker;
      Juliet says, &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; and disappears, but he finds time to give us the
      abstract truth:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Love goes towards love, as schoolboys from their books,
  But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Juliet appears again unexpectedly, and again Hamlet's generalizing habit
      asserts itself in Romeo:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
  Like softest music to attending ears.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      We may be certain that Juliet would have preferred more pointed praise. He
      is indeed so lost in his ill-timed reverie that Juliet has to call him
      again and again by name before he attends to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romeo has Hamlet's peculiar habit of talking to himself. He falls into a
      soliloquy on his way to Juliet in Capulet's orchard, when his heart must
      have been beating so loudly that it would have prevented him from hearing
      himself talk, and into another when hurrying to the apothecary. In this
      latter monologue, too, when all his thoughts must have been of Juliet and
      their star-crossed fates, and love-devouring Death, he is able to picture
      for us the apothecary and his shop with a wealth of detail that says more
      for Shakespeare's painstaking and memory than for his insight into
      character. The fault, however, is not so grave as it would be if Romeo
      were a different kind of man; but like Hamlet he is always ready to unpack
      his heart with words, and if they are not the best words sometimes,
      sometimes even very inappropriate words, it only shows that in his first
      tragedy Shakespeare was not the master of his art that he afterwards
      became.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the churchyard scene of the fifth act Romeo's likeness to Hamlet comes
      into clearest light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet says to Laertes:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I pr'ythee, take thy fingers from my throat;
  For though I am not splenitive and rash
  Yet have I something in me dangerous
  Which let thy wisdom fear.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In precisely the same temper, Romeo says to Paris:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Good, gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
  Fly hence and leave me; think upon these gone,
  Let them affright thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This magnanimity is so rare that its existence would almost of itself be
      sufficient to establish a close relationship between Romeo and Hamlet.
      Romeo's last speech, too, is characteristic of Hamlet: on the very
      threshold of death he generalizes:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;How oft when men are at the point of death,
  Have they been merry? which their keepers call
  A lightening before death.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There is in Romeo, too, that peculiar mixture of pensive sadness and
      loving sympathy which is the very vesture of Hamlet's soul; he says to
      &ldquo;Noble County Paris&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;O, give me thy hand,
  One writ with me in sour misfortune's book.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And finally Shakespeare's supreme lyrical gift is used by Romeo as
      unconstrainedly as by Hamlet himself. The beauty in the last soliloquy is
      of passion rather than of intellect, but in sheer triumphant beauty some
      lines of it have never been surpassed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Here, here will I remain
  With worms that are thy chambermaids; O, here
  Will I set up my everlasting rest
  And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
  From this world-wearied flesh.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The whole soliloquy and especially the superb epithet &ldquo;world-wearied&rdquo; are
      at least as suitable to Hamlet as to Romeo. Passion, it is true, is more
      accentuated in Romeo, just as there is greater irresolution combined with
      intenser self-consciousness in Hamlet, yet all the qualities of the
      youthful lover are to be found in the student-prince. Hamlet is evidently
      the later finished picture of which Romeo was merely the charming sketch.
      Hamlet says he is revengeful and ambitious, although he is nothing of the
      kind, and in much the same way Romeo says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I'll be a candle-holder and look on,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      whereas he plays the chief part and a very active part in the drama. If he
      were more of a &ldquo;candle-holder&rdquo; and onlooker, he would more resemble
      Hamlet. Then too, though he generalizes, he does not search the darkness
      with aching eyeballs as Hamlet does; the problems of life do not as yet
      lie heavy on his soul; he is too young to have felt their mystery and
      terror; he is only just within the shadow of that melancholy which to
      Hamlet discolours the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven or eight years after writing &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo; Shakespeare growing
      conscious of these changes in his own temperament embodied them in another
      character, the melancholy &ldquo;Jaques&rdquo; in &ldquo;As You Like It.&rdquo; Every one knows
      that Jaques is Shakespeare's creation; he is not to be found in Lodge's
      &ldquo;Rosalynde,&rdquo; whence Shakespeare took the story and most of the characters
      of his play. Jaques is only sketched in with light strokes, but all his
      traits are peculiarly Hamlet's traits. For Jaques is a melancholy student
      of life as Hamlet is, with lightning-quick intelligence and heavy heart,
      and these are the Hamlet qualities which were not brought into prominence
      in the youthful Romeo. Passages taken at haphazard will suffice to
      establish my contention. &ldquo;Motley's the only wear,&rdquo; says Jaques, as if
      longing to assume the cap and bells, and Hamlet plays the fool's part with
      little better reason. Jaques exclaims:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                           &ldquo;Give me leave
  To speak my mind, and I will through and through
  Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
  If they will patiently receive my medicine.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And Hamlet cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The Time is out of joint; O cursèd spite
  That ever I was born to set it right.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The famous speech of Jaques, &ldquo;All the world's a stage,&rdquo; might have been
      said by Hamlet, indeed belongs of right to the person who gave the
      exquisite counsel to the players. Jaques' confession of melancholy, too,
      both in manner and matter is characteristic of Hamlet. How often
      Shakespeare must have thought it over before he was able to bring the
      peculiar nature of his own malady into such relief:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is emulation; nor the
      musician's, which is fantastical; nor the courtier's, which is proud; nor
      the soldier's, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor
      the lady's, which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is
      a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many
      objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my travels; which, by
      often rumination, wraps me in, a most humourous sadness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This &ldquo;humourous sadness,&rdquo; the child of contemplation, was indeed
      Shakespeare's most constant mood. Jaques, too, loves solitude and the
      country as Hamlet loved them&mdash;and above all the last trait recorded
      of Jaques, his eagerness to see the reformed Duke and learn from the
      convert, is a perfect example of that intellectual curiosity which is one
      of Hamlet's most attaching characteristics. Yet another trait is
      attributed to Jaques, which we must on no account forget. The Duke accuses
      him of lewdness though lewdness seems out of place in Jaques's character,
      and is certainly not shown in the course of the action. If we combine the
      characters of Romeo, the poet-lover, and Jaques, the pensive-sad
      philosopher, we have almost the complete Hamlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is conceivable that even a fair-minded reader of the plays will admit
      all I have urged about the likeness of Romeo and Jaques to Hamlet without
      concluding that these preliminary studies, so to speak, for the great
      portrait render it at all certain that the masterpiece of portraiture is a
      likeness of Shakespeare himself. The impartial critic will probably say,
      &ldquo;You have raised a suspicion in my mind; a strong suspicion it may be, but
      still a suspicion that is far from certitude.&rdquo; Fortunately the evidence
      still to be offered is a thousand times more convincing than any
      inferences that can properly be drawn from Romeo or from Jaques, or even
      from both together.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. HAMLET&mdash;MACBETH
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a later drama of Shakespeare's, a drama which comes between
      &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lear,&rdquo; and belongs, therefore, to the topmost height of the
      poet's achievement, whose principal character is Hamlet, Hamlet over
      again, with every peculiarity and every fault; a Hamlet, too, entangled in
      an action which is utterly unsuited to his nature. Surely if this
      statement can be proved, it will be admitted by all competent judges that
      the identity of Hamlet and his creator has been established. For
      Shakespeare must have painted this second Hamlet unconsciously. Think of
      it. In totally new circumstances the poet speaks with Hamlet's voice in
      Hamlet's words. The only possible explanation is that he is speaking from
      his own heart, and for that reason is unaware of the mistake. The drama I
      refer to is &ldquo;Macbeth.&rdquo; No one, so far as I know, has yet thought of
      showing that there is any likeness between the character of Hamlet and
      that of Macbeth, much less identity; nevertheless, it seems to me easy to
      prove that Macbeth, &ldquo;the rugged Macbeth,&rdquo; as Hazlitt and Brandes call him,
      is merely our gentle irresolute, humanist, philosopher Hamlet masquerading
      in galligaskins as a Scottish thane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take the first appearance of Macbeth, and we are forced to remark
      at once that he acts and speaks exactly as Hamlet in like circumstances
      would act and speak. The honest but slow Banquo is amazed when Macbeth
      starts and seems to fear the fair promises of the witches; he does not see
      what the nimble Hamlet-intellect has seen in a flash&mdash;the dread means
      by which alone the promises can be brought to fulfilment. As soon as
      Macbeth is hailed &ldquo;Thane of Cawdor&rdquo; Banquo warns him, but Macbeth, in
      spite of the presence of others, falls at once, as Hamlet surely would
      have fallen, into a soliloquy: a thing, considering the circumstances,
      most false to general human nature, for what he says must excite Banquo's
      suspicion, and is only true to the Hamlet-mind, that in and out of season
      loses itself in meditation. The soliloquy, too, is startlingly
      characteristic of Hamlet. After giving expression to the merely natural
      uplifting of his hope, Macbeth begins to weigh the for and against like a
      student-thinker:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;This supernatural soliciting
  Cannot be ill; cannot be good; if ill,
  Why hath it given me earnest of success,
  Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
  If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
  Whose horrid image ...
                           ... function
  Is smothered in surmise and nothing is
  But what is not,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When Banquo draws attention to him as &ldquo;rapt,&rdquo; Macbeth still goes on
      talking to himself, for at length he has found arguments against action:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;If chance will have me King, why chance may crown me,
  Without my stir,&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      all in the true Hamlet vein. At the end of the act, Macbeth when excusing
      himself to his companions becomes the student of Wittenberg in proper
      person. The courteous kindliness of the words is almost as characteristic
      as the bookish illustration:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Kind gentlemen, your pains
  Are registered where every day I turn
  The leaf to read them.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      If this is not Hamlet's very tone, manner and phrase, then individuality
      of nature has no peculiar voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have laid such stress upon this, the first scene in which Macbeth
      appears, because the first appearance is by far the most important for the
      purpose of establishing the main outlines of a character; first
      impressions in a drama being exceedingly difficult to modify and almost
      impossible to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macbeth, however, acts Hamlet from one end of the play to the other; and
      Lady Macbeth's first appearance (a personage almost as important to the
      drama as Macbeth himself) is used by Shakespeare to confirm this view of
      Macbeth's character. After reading her husband's letter almost her first
      words are:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Yet do I fear thy nature.
  It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
  To catch the nearest way.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      What is this but a more perfect expression of Hamlet's nature than Hamlet
      himself gives? Hamlet declares bitterly that he is &ldquo;pigeon livered,&rdquo; and
      lacks &ldquo;gall to make oppression bitter&rdquo;; he says to Laertes, &ldquo;I loved you
      ever,&rdquo; and to his mother:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I must be cruel only to be kind,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and she tells the King that he wept for Polonius' death. But the best
      phrase for his gentle-heartedness is what Lady Macbeth gives here: he is
      &ldquo;too full o' the milk of human kindness.&rdquo; The words are as true of the
      Scottish chieftain as of the Wittenberg student; in heart they are one and
      the same person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though excited to action by his wife, Macbeth's last words in this scene
      are to postpone decision. &ldquo;We will speak further,&rdquo; he says, whereupon the
      woman takes the lead, warns him to dissemble, and adds, &ldquo;leave all the
      rest to me.&rdquo; Macbeth's doubting, irresolution, and dislike of action could
      hardly be more forcibly portrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seventh scene of the first act begins with another long soliloquy by
      Macbeth, and this soliloquy shows us not only Hamlet's irresolution and
      untimely love of meditation, but also the peculiar pendulum-swing of
      Hamlet's thought:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
  It were done quickly: if the assassination
  Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
  With his surcease success: that but this blow
  Might be the be-all and the end-all; here,
  But here upon this bank and shoal of time
  We'd jump the life to come. . . . .&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Is not this the same soul which also in a soliloquy questions fate?&mdash;&ldquo;Whether
      'tis better in the mind....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macbeth, too, has Hamlet's peculiar and exquisite intellectual fairness&mdash;a
      quality, be it remarked in passing, seldom found in a ruthless murderer.
      He sees even the King's good points:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    ...... &ldquo;this Duncan
  Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
  So clear in his great office, that his virtues
  Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
  The deep damnation of his taking off.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Is it not like Hamlet to be able to condemn himself in this way
      beforehand? Macbeth ends this soliloquy with words which come from the
      inmost of Hamlet's heart:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;I have no spur
  To prick the sides of my intent, but only
  Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself,
  And falls on the other.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hamlet, too, has no spur to prick the sides of his intent, and Hamlet,
      too, would be sure to see how apt ambition is to overleap itself, and so
      would blunt the sting of the desire. This monologue alone should have been
      sufficient to reveal to all critics the essential identity of Hamlet and
      Macbeth. Lady Macbeth, too, tells us that Macbeth left the supper table
      where he was entertaining the King, in order to indulge himself in this
      long monologue, and when he hears that his absence has excited comment,
      that he has been asked for even by the King, he does not attempt to excuse
      his strange conduct, he merely says, &ldquo;We will proceed no further in this
      business,&rdquo; showing in true Hamlet fashion how resolution has been
      &ldquo;sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought.&rdquo; In fact, as his wife says
      to him, he lets &ldquo;'I dare not' wait upon 'I would' like the poor cat i' the
      adage.&rdquo; Even when whipped to action by Lady Macbeth's preternatural
      eagerness, he asks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;If we should fail?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      whereupon she tells him to screw his courage to the sticking place, and
      describes the deed itself. Infected by her masculine resolution, Macbeth
      at length consents to what he calls the &ldquo;terrible feat.&rdquo; The word
      &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; here is surely more characteristic of the humane poet-thinker
      than of the chieftain-murderer. Even at this crisis, too, of his fate
      Macbeth cannot cheat himself; like Hamlet he is compelled to see himself
      as he is:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;False face must hide what the false heart doth know.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I have now considered nearly every word used by Macbeth in this first act:
      I have neither picked passages nor omitted anything that might make
      against my argument; yet every impartial reader must acknowledge that
      Hamlet is far more clearly sketched in this first act of &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; than in
      the first act of &ldquo;Hamlet.&rdquo; Macbeth appears in it as an irresolute dreamer,
      courteous, and gentle-hearted, of perfect intellectual fairness and
      bookish phrase; and in especial his love of thought and dislike of action
      are insisted upon again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the fact that the second act is one chiefly of incident,
      filled indeed with the murder and its discovery, Shakespeare uses Macbeth
      as the mouthpiece of his marvellous lyrical faculty as freely as he uses
      Hamlet. A greater singer even than Romeo, Hamlet is a poet by nature, and
      turns every possible occasion to account, charming the ear with subtle
      harmonies. With a father's murder to avenge, he postpones action and sings
      to himself of life and death and the undiscovered country in words of such
      magical spirit-beauty that they can be compared to nothing in the world's
      literature save perhaps to the last chapter of Ecclesiastes. From the
      beginning to the end of the drama Hamlet is a great lyric poet, and this
      supreme personal gift is so natural to him that it is hardly mentioned by
      the critics. This gift, however, is possessed by Macbeth in at least equal
      degree and excites just as little notice. It is credible that Shakespeare
      used the drama sometimes as a means of reaching the highest lyrical
      utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without pressing this point further let us now take up the second act of
      the play. Banquo and Fleance enter; Macbeth has a few words with them;
      they depart, and after giving a servant an order, Macbeth begins another
      long soliloquy. He thinks he sees a dagger before him, and immediately
      falls to philosophizing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 &ldquo;Come let me clutch thee:&mdash;
  I have thee not and yet I see thee still.
  Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
  To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
  A dagger of the mind, a false creation
  Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
  I see thee yet in form as palpable
  As that which now I draw....
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses.
  Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
  And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
  Which was not so before.&mdash;There's no such thing.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      What is all this but an illustration of Hamlet's assertion:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;There is nothing either good or bad
  But thinking makes it so.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Just too as Hamlet swings on his mental balance, so that it is still a
      debated question among academic critics whether his madness was feigned or
      real, so here Shakespeare shows us how Macbeth loses his foothold on
      reality and falls into the void.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lyrical effusion that follows is not very successful, and probably on
      that account Macbeth breaks off abruptly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Whiles I threat he lives,
  Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      which is, of course, precisely Hamlet's complaint:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;This is most brave;
  That I, the son of a dear father murdered,
  Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
  Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      After this Lady Macbeth enters, and the murder is committed, and now
      wrought to the highest tension Macbeth must speak from the depths of his
      nature with perfect sincerity. Will he exult, as the ambitious man would,
      at having taken successfully the longest step towards his goal? Or will
      he, like a prudent man, do his utmost to hide the traces of his crime, and
      hatch plans to cast suspicion on others? It is Lady Macbeth who plays this
      part; she tells Macbeth to &ldquo;get some water,&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And wash this filthy witness from your hand,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      while he, brainsick, rehearses past fears and shows himself the sensitive
      poet-dreamer inclined to piety: here is the incredible scene:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Lady M.</i> There are two lodged together.
  <i>Macb</i>. One cried, 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other,
  As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
  Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
  When they did say 'God bless us.'
  <i>Lady M</i>.        Consider it not so deeply.
  <i>Macb</i>. But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
  I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
  Stuck in my throat.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This religious tinge colouring the weakness of self-pity is to be found
      again and again in &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;; Hamlet, too, is religious-minded; he begs
      Ophelia to remember his sins in her orisons. When he first sees his
      father's ghost he cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Angels and ministers of grace defend us,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and when the ghost leaves him his word is, &ldquo;I'll go pray.&rdquo; This new trait,
      most intimate and distinctive, is therefore the most conclusive proof of
      the identity of the two characters. The whole passage in the mouth of a
      murderer is utterly unexpected and out of place; no wonder Lady Macbeth
      exclaims:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             &ldquo;These deeds must not be thought
  After these ways: so, it will make us mad.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But nothing can restrain Macbeth; he gives rein to his poetic imagination,
      and breaks out in an exquisite lyric, a lyric which has hardly any closer
      relation to the circumstances than its truth to Shakespeare's nature:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Methought I heard a voice cry, 'Sleep no more!
  Macbeth does murder sleep,'&mdash;the innocent sleep:
  Sleep, that knits up the ravelled sleave of care,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and so forth&mdash;the poet in love with his own imaginings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Lady Macbeth tries to bring him back to a sense of reality; tells
      him his thinking unbends his strength, and finally urges him to take the
      daggers back and
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                          &ldquo;smear
  The sleepy grooms with the blood.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But Macbeth's nerve is gone; he is physically broken now as well as
      mentally o'erwrought; he cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     &ldquo;I'll go no more;
  I am afraid to think what I have done.
  Look on't again I dare not.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All this is exquisitely characteristic of the nervous student who has been
      screwed up to a feat beyond his strength, &ldquo;a terrible feat,&rdquo; and who has
      broken down over it, but the words are altogether absurd in the mouth of
      an ambitious, half-barbarous chieftain.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife chides him as fanciful, childish&mdash;&ldquo;infirm of purpose,&rdquo;&mdash;she'll
      put the daggers back herself; but nothing can hearten Macbeth; every
      household noise sets his heart thumping:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                   &ldquo;Whence is that knocking?
  How is't with me when every noise appals me?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      His mind rocks; he even imagines he is being tortured:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              &ldquo;What hands are here? Ha!
  They pluck out my eyes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then he swings into another incomparable lyric:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
  Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
  The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
  Making the green one red.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There is a great deal of the poet-neuropath and very little of the
      murderer for ambition's sake in this lyrical hysteria. No wonder Lady
      Macbeth declares she would be ashamed &ldquo;to wear a heart so white.&rdquo; It is
      all Hamlet over again, Hamlet wrought up to a higher pitch of intensity.
      And here it should be remembered that &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; was written three years
      after &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and probably just before &ldquo;Lear&rdquo;; one would therefore expect
      a greater intensity and a deeper pessimism in Macbeth than in Hamlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character-drawing in the next scene is necessarily slight. The
      discovery of the murder impels every one save the protagonist to action,
      but Macbeth finds time even at the climax of excitement to coin
      Hamlet-words that can never be forgotten:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;There's nothing serious in mortality;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and the description of Duncan:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;His silver skin laced with his golden blood&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;as sugar'd sweet as any line in the sonnets, and here completely
      out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these first two acts the character of Macbeth is outlined so firmly
      that no after-touches can efface the impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now comes a period in the drama in which deed follows so fast upon deed,
      that there is scarcely any opportunity for characterization. To the casual
      view Macbeth seems almost to change his nature, passing from murder to
      murder quickly if not easily. He not only arranges for Banquo's
      assassination, but leaves Lady Macbeth innocent of the knowledge. The
      explanation of this seeming change of character is at hand. Shakespeare
      took the history of Macbeth from Holinshed's Chronicle, and there it is
      recorded that Macbeth murdered Banquo and many others, as well as
      Macduff's wife and children. Holinshed makes Duncan have &ldquo;too much of
      clemencie,&rdquo; and Macbeth &ldquo;too much of crueltie.&rdquo; Macbeth's actions
      correspond with his nature in Holinshed; but Shakespeare first made
      Macbeth in his own image&mdash;gentle, bookish and irresolute&mdash;and
      then found himself fettered by the historical fact that Macbeth murdered
      Banquo and the rest. He was therefore forced to explain in some way or
      other why his Macbeth strode from crime to crime. It must be noted as most
      characteristic of gentle Shakespeare that even when confronted with this
      difficulty he did not think of lending Macbeth any tinge of cruelty,
      harshness, or ambition. His Macbeth commits murder for the same reason
      that the timorous deer fights&mdash;out of fear.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;To be thus is nothing;
  But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo
  Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
  Reigns that which would be feared&rdquo;:
</pre>
    <p>
      And again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;There is none but he
  Whose being I do fear&rdquo;:...
</pre>
    <p>
      This proves, as nothing else could prove, the all-pervading, attaching
      kindness of Shakespeare's nature. Again and again Lady Macbeth saves the
      situation and tries to shame her husband into stern resolve, but in vain;
      he's &ldquo;quite unmann'd in folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had Macbeth been made ambitious, as the commentators assume, there would
      have been a sufficient motive for his later actions. But ambition is
      foreign to the Shakespeare-Hamlet nature, so the poet does not employ it.
      Again and again he returns to the explanation that the timid grow
      dangerous when &ldquo;frighted out of fear.&rdquo; Macbeth says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer
  Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep
  In the affliction of these terrible dreams
  That shake us nightly.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In passing I may remark that Hamlet, too, complains of &ldquo;bad dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In deep Hamlet melancholy, Macbeth now begins to contrast his state with
      Duncan's:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.
  Treason has done his worst: nor steel nor poison,
  Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
  Can touch him further.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Lady Macbeth begs him to sleek o'er his rugged looks, be bright and
      jovial. He promises obedience; but soon falls into the dark mood again and
      predicts &ldquo;a deed of dreadful note.&rdquo; Naturally his wife questions him, and
      he replies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
  Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
  Scarf up the tender eye of pityful day,
  And with thy bloody and invisible hand
  Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
  Which keeps me pale.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      No other motive for murder is possible to Shakespeare-Macbeth but fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banquo is murdered, but still Macbeth cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in
  To saucy doubts and fears.&rdquo;
 The scene with the ghost of Banquo follows, where-in Macbeth again shows
the nervous imaginative Hamlet nature. His next speech is mere
reflection, and again Hamlet might have framed it:

                                &ldquo;the time has been
  That when the brains were out the man would die
  And there an end&rdquo;: ...
</pre>
    <p>
      But while fear may be an adequate motive for Banquo's murder, it can
      hardly explain the murder of Macduff's wife and children. Shakespeare
      feels this, too, and therefore finds other reasons natural enough; but the
      first of these reasons, &ldquo;his own good,&rdquo; is not especially characteristic
      of Macbeth, and the second, while perhaps characteristic, is absurdly
      inadequate: men don't murder out of tediousness:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              &ldquo;For mine own good
  All causes shall give way: I am in blood{1}
  Stepped in so far, that, should I wade no more,
  Returning were as tedious as go o'er.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: It seems to me probable that Shakespeare, unable to find an
      adequate motive for murder, borrowed this one from &ldquo;Richard III.&rdquo; Richard
      says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                             &ldquo;But I am in
  So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      This is an explanation following the fact rather than a cause producing it&mdash;an
      explanation, moreover, which may be true in the case of a fiendlike
      Richard, but is not true of a Macbeth.}
    </p>
    <p>
      Take it all in all, this latter reason is as poor a motive for
      cold-blooded murder as was ever given, and Shakespeare again feels this,
      for he brings in the witches once more to predict safety to Macbeth and
      adjure him to be &ldquo;bloody, bold and resolute.&rdquo; When they have thus screwed
      his courage to the sticking place as his wife did before, Macbeth resolves
      on Macduff's murder, but he immediately recurs to the old explanation; he
      does not do it for his &ldquo;own good&rdquo; nor because &ldquo;returning is tedious &ldquo;; he
      does it
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
  And sleep in spite of thunder.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is fair to say that Shakespeare's Macbeth is so gentle-kind, that he
      can find no motive in himself for murder, save fear. The words Shakespeare
      puts into Hubert's mouth in &ldquo;King John&rdquo; are really his own confession:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Within this bosom never enter'd yet
  The dreadful motion of a murderous thought.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The murders take place and the silly scenes in England between Malcolm and
      Macduff follow, and then come Lady Macbeth's illness, and the
      characteristic end. The servant tells Macbeth of the approach of the
      English force, and he begins the wonderful monologue:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                           &ldquo;my May of life
  Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
  And that which should accompany old age,
  As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
  I must not look to have; but in their stead
  Curses, not loud, but deep, mouth-honour, breath
  Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Truly this is a strange murderer who longs for &ldquo;troops of friends,&rdquo; and
      who at the last push of fate can find in himself kindness enough towards
      others to sympathize with the &ldquo;poor heart.&rdquo; All this is pure Hamlet; one
      might better say, pure Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are next led into the field with Malcolm and Macduff, and immediately
      back to the castle again. While the women break into cries, Macbeth
      soliloquizes in the very spirit of bookish Hamlet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
  The time has been, my senses would have cooled
  To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
  Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
  As life were in 't.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The whole passage, and especially the &ldquo;dismal treatise,&rdquo; recalls the
      Wittenberg student with a magic of representment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of the Queen is announced, and wrings from Macbeth a speech full
      of despairing pessimism, a bitterer mood than ever Hamlet knew; a speech,
      moreover, that shows the student as well as the incomparable lyric poet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;She should have died hereafter:
  There would have been a time for such a word.&mdash;
  To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
  Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
  To the last syllable of recorded time;
  And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
  The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
  Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player,
  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
  And then is heard no more: it is a tale
  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
  Signifying nothing.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Macbeth's philosophy, like Hamlet's, ends in utter doubt, in a passion of
      contempt for life, deeper than anything in Dante. The word &ldquo;syllable&rdquo; in
      this lyric outburst is as characteristic as the &ldquo;dismal treatise&rdquo; in the
      previous one, and more characteristic still of Hamlet is the likening of
      life to &ldquo;a poor player.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The messenger tells Macbeth that Birnam Wood has begun to move, and he
      sees that the witches have cheated him. He can only say, as Hamlet might
      have said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I 'gin to be aweary of the sun,
  And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.&mdash;
  Ring the alarum bell! Blow wind! Come, wrack!
  At least we'll die with harness on our back.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And later he cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
  But bear-like I must fight the course.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This seems to me intensely characteristic of Hamlet; the brutal side of
      action was never more contemptuously described, and Macbeth's next
      soliloquy makes the identity apparent to every one; it is in the true
      thinker-sceptic vein:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Why should I play the Roman{1} fool and die
  On mine own sword?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: About the year 1600 Shakespeare seems to have steeped himself
      in Plutarch. For the next five or six years, whenever he thinks of
      suicide, the Roman way of looking at it occurs to him. Having made up his
      mind to kill himself, Laertes cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am more an antique Roman than a Dane,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and, in like case, Cleopatra talks of dying &ldquo;after the high Roman
      fashion."}
    </p>
    <p>
      Macbeth then meets Macduff, and there follows the confession of pity and
      remorse, which must be compared to the gentle-kindness with which Hamlet
      treats Laertes and Romeo treats Paris. Macbeth says to Macduff:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Of all men else I have avoided thee:
  But get thee back, my soul is too much charged
  With blood of thine already.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then comes the &ldquo;something desperate&rdquo; in him that Hamlet boasted of&mdash;and
      the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we have every characteristic of Hamlet without exception, The crying
      difference of situation only brings out the essential identity of the two
      characters. The two portraits are of the same person and finished to the
      finger-tips. The slight shades of difference between Macbeth and Hamlet
      only strengthen our contention that both are portraits of the poet; for
      the differences are manifestly changes in the same character, and changes
      due merely to age. Just as Romeo is younger than Hamlet, showing passion
      where Hamlet shows thought, so Macbeth is older than Hamlet; in Macbeth
      the melancholy has grown deeper, the tone more pessimistic, and the heart
      gentler. {Footnote: Immediately after the publication of these first two
      essays, Sir Henry Irving seized the opportunity and lectured before a
      distinguished audience on the character of Macbeth. He gave it as his
      opinion that &ldquo;Shakespeare has presented Macbeth as one of the most
      blood-thirsty, most hypocritical villains in his long gallery of men,
      instinct with the virtues and vices of their kind (<i>sic</i>).&rdquo; Sir Henry
      Irving also took the occasion to praise the simile of pity:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
  Striding the blast.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This ridiculous fustian seemed to him &ldquo;very beautiful.&rdquo; All this was
      perfectly gratuitous: no one needed to be informed that a man might have
      merit as an actor and yet be without any understanding of psychology or
      any taste in letters.} I venture, therefore, to assert that the portrait
      we find in Romeo and Jaques first, and then in Hamlet, and afterwards in
      Macbeth, is the portrait of Shakespeare himself, and we can trace his
      personal development through these three stages.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. DUKE VINCENTIO&mdash;POSTHUMUS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It may be well to add here a couple of portraits of Shakespeare in later
      life in order to establish beyond question the chief features of his
      character. With this purpose in mind I shall take a portrait that is a
      mere sketch of him, Duke Vincentio in &ldquo;Measure for Measure,&rdquo; and a
      portrait that is minutely finished and perfect, though consciously
      idealized, Posthumus, in &ldquo;Cymbeline.&rdquo; And the reason I take this careless,
      wavering sketch, and contrast it with a highly-finished portrait, is that,
      though the sketch is here and there hardly recognizable, the outline being
      all too thin and hesitating, yet now and then a characteristic trait is
      over-emphasized, as we should expect in careless work. And this sketch in
      lines now faint, now all too heavy, is curiously convincing when put side
      by side with a careful and elaborate portrait in which the same traits are
      reproduced, but harmoniously, and with a perfect sense of the relative
      value of each feature. No critic, so far as I am aware, not Hazlitt, not
      Brandes, not even Coleridge, has yet thought of identifying either Duke
      Vincentio or Posthumus with Hamlet, much less with Shakespeare himself.
      The two plays are very unlike each other in tone and temper; &ldquo;Measure for
      Measure&rdquo; being a sort of tract for the times, while &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo; is a
      purely romantic drama. Moreover, &ldquo;Measure for Measure&rdquo; was probably
      written a couple of years after &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; towards the end of 1603, while
      &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo; belongs to the last period of the poet's activity, and could
      hardly have been completed before 1610 or 1611. The dissimilarity of the
      plays only accentuates the likeness of the two protagonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Measure for Measure&rdquo; is one of the best examples of Shakespeare's
      contempt for stagecraft. Not only is the mechanism of the play, as we
      shall see later, astonishingly slipshod, but the ostensible purpose of the
      play, which is to make the laws respected in Vienna, is not only not
      attained, but seems at the end to be rather despised than forgotten. This
      indifference to logical consistency is characteristic of Shakespeare;
      Hamlet speaks of &ldquo;the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller
      returns&rdquo; just after he has been talking with his dead father. The poetic
      dreamer cannot take the trouble to tie up the loose ends of a story: the
      real purpose of &ldquo;Measure for Measure,&rdquo; which is the confusion of the
      pretended ascetic Angelo, is fulfilled, and that is sufficient for the
      thinker, who has thus shown what &ldquo;our seemers be.&rdquo; It is no less
      characteristic of Shakespeare that Duke Vincentio, his <i>alter ego</i>,
      should order another to punish loose livers&mdash;a task which his kindly
      nature found too disagreeable. But, leaving these general considerations,
      let us come to the first scene of the first act: the second long speech of
      the Duke should have awakened the suspicion that Vincentio is but another
      mask for Shakespeare. The whole speech proclaims the poet; the Duke
      begins:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                  &ldquo;Angelo
  There is a kind of character in thy life,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hamlet says to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in what is supposed to be
      prose:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;There is a kind of confession in your looks.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A little later the line:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;Spirits are not finely touched
  But to fine issues,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      is so characteristic of Hamlet-Shakespeare that it should have put every
      reader on the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speeches of the Duke in the fourth scene of the first act are also
      characteristic of Shakespeare. But the four lines,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My holy sir, none better knows than you
  How I have ever loved the life removed,
  And held in idle price to haunt assemblies,
  Where youth and cost and witless bravery keep,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      are to me an intimate, personal confession; a fuller rendering indeed of
      Hamlet's &ldquo;Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither.&rdquo; In any case it will
      be admitted that a dislike of assemblies and cost and witless bravery is
      peculiar in a reigning monarch, so peculiar indeed that it reminds me of
      the exiled Duke in &ldquo;As You Like It,&rdquo; or of Duke Prospero in &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo;
       (two other incarnations of Shakespeare), rather than of any one in real
      life. A love of solitude; a keen contempt for shows and the &ldquo;witless
      bravery&rdquo; of court-life were, as we shall see, characteristics of
      Shakespeare from youth to old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first scene of the third act the Duke as a friar speaks to the
      condemned Claudio. He argues as Hamlet would argue, but with, I think, a
      more convinced hopelessness. The deepening scepticism would of itself
      force us to place &ldquo;Measure for Measure&rdquo; a little later than &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 &ldquo;Reason thus with life:&mdash;
  If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
  That none but fools would keep; a breath thou art,
         - -       - -       - -       - -
                           The best of rest is sleep,
  And that thou oft provok'st, yet grossly fear'st
  Thy death, which is no more. Thou'rt not thyself;
  For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
  That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
  For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,
  And what thou hast, forgett'st.
         - -       - -       - -       - -
                                   What's in this,
  That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
  Lie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear,
  That makes these odds all even.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      That this scepticism of Vincentio is Shakespeare's scepticism appears from
      the fact that the whole speech is worse than out of place when addressed
      to a person under sentence of death. Were we to take it seriously, it
      would show the Duke to be curiously callous to the sufferings of the
      condemned Claudio; but callous the Duke is not, he is merely a pensive
      poet-philosopher talking in order to lighten his own heart. Claudio makes
      unconscious fun of the Duke's argument:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;To sue to live, I find I seek to die,
  And seeking death, find life: let it come on.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This scepticism of Shakespeare which shows itself out of place in Angelo
      and again most naturally in Claudio's famous speech, is one of the salient
      traits of his character which is altogether over-emphasized in this play.
      It is a trait, moreover, which finds expression in almost everything he
      wrote. Like nearly all the great spirits of the Renaissance, Shakespeare
      was perpetually occupied with the heavy problems of man's life and man's
      destiny. Was there any meaning or purpose in life, any result of the
      striving? was Death to be feared or a Hereafter to be desired?&mdash;incessantly
      he beat straining wings in the void. But even in early manhood he never
      sought to deceive himself. His Richard II. had sounded the shallow vanity
      of man's desires, the futility of man's hopes; he knew that man
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
  With being nothing.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And this sad knowledge darkened all Shakespeare's later thinking.
      Naturally, when youth passed from him and disillusionment put an end to
      dreaming, his melancholy deepened, his sadness became despairing; we can
      see the shadows thickening round him into night. Brutus takes an
      &ldquo;everlasting farewell&rdquo; of his friend, and goes willingly to his rest.
      Hamlet dreads &ldquo;the undiscovered country&rdquo;; but unsentient death is to him
      &ldquo;a consummation devoutly to be wished.&rdquo; Vincentio's mood is
      half-contemptuous, but the melancholy persists; death is no &ldquo;more than
      sleep,&rdquo; he says, and life a series of deceptions; while Claudio in this
      same play shudders away from death as from annihilation, or worse, in
      words which one cannot help regarding as Shakespeare's:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Claud</i>. Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
  To lie in cold obstruction and to rot....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A little later and Macbeth's soul cries to us from the outer darkness:
      &ldquo;there's nothing serious in mortality&rdquo;; life's
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              &ldquo;a tale
  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
  Signifying nothing.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And from this despairing gloom come Lear's shrieks of pain and pitiful
      ravings, and in the heavy intervals the gibberings of the fool. Even when
      the calmer mood of age came upon Shakespeare and took away the bitterness,
      he never recanted; Posthumus speaks of life and death in almost the words
      used by Vincentio, and Prospero has nothing to add save that &ldquo;our little
      life is rounded with a sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is noteworthy that Shakespeare always gives these philosophic
      questionings to those characters whom I regard as his impersonations,{1}
      and when he breaks this rule, he breaks it in favour of some Claudio who
      is not a character at all, but the mere mouthpiece of one of his moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: One of my correspondents, Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton, has been
      kind enough to send me an article contributed to &ldquo;Colbourn's Magazine&rdquo; in
      1873, in which he declares that &ldquo;Shakespeare seems to have kept a sort of
      Hamlet notebook, full of Hamlet thoughts, of which 'To be or not to be'
      may be taken as the type. These he was burdened with. These did he cram
      into Hamlet as far as he could, and then he tossed the others
      indiscriminately into other plays, tragedies and histories, perfectly
      regardless of the character who uttered them.&rdquo; Though Mr. Watts-Dunton
      sees that some of these &ldquo;Hamlet thoughts&rdquo; are to be found in Macbeth and
      Prospero and Claudio, he evidently lacks the key to Shakespeare's
      personality, or he would never have said that Shakespeare tossed these
      reflections &ldquo;indiscriminately into other plays.&rdquo; Nevertheless the
      statement itself is interesting, and deserves more notice than has been
      accorded to it.}
    </p>
    <p>
      I now come to a point in the drama which at once demands and defies
      explanation. In the first scene of the third act the Duke, after listening
      to the terrible discussion between Isabella and Claudio, first of all
      tells Claudio that &ldquo;Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt&rdquo; Isabella, and
      then assures Claudio that to-morrow he must die. The explanation of these
      two falsehoods would be far to seek, unless we take it that they were
      invented simply in order to prolong our interest in the drama. But this
      assumption, though probable, does not increase our sympathy with the
      protagonist&mdash;the lies seem to be too carelessly uttered to be even
      characteristic&mdash;nor yet our admiration of the structure of a play
      that needs to be supported by such flimsy buttresses. Still this very
      carelessness of fact, as I have said, is Shakespearean; the philosophic
      dreamer paid little attention to the mere incidents of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk between the Duke and Isabella follows. The form of the Duke's
      speech, with its touch of euphuistic conceit, is one which
      Hamlet-Shakespeare affects:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The hand that hath made you fair hath made you
  good: the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes
  beauty brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
  your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This Duke plays philosopher, too, in and out of season as Hamlet did: he
      says to Isabella:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      generalizing his praise even to a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, when Pompey is arrested, he passes from the individual to the
      general, exclaiming:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;That we were all as some would seem to be,
  Free from our faults, as from faults seeming free.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then follows the interesting talk with Lucio, who awakens the slightly
      pompous Duke to natural life with his contempt. When Lucio tells the Duke,
      who is disguised as a friar, that he (the Duke) was a notorious
      loose-liver&mdash;&ldquo;he had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service&rdquo;&mdash;the
      Duke merely denies the soft impeachment; but when Lucio tells him that the
      Duke is not wise, but &ldquo;a very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow,&rdquo;
       the Duke bursts out, &ldquo;either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking: ...
      Let him but be testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear
      to the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier,&rdquo; which recalls
      Hamlet's &ldquo;Friends, scholars, and soldiers,&rdquo; and Ophelia's praise of Hamlet
      as &ldquo;courtier, soldier, scholar.&rdquo; Lucio goes off, and the Duke &ldquo;moralizes&rdquo;
       the incident in Hamlet's very accent:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;No might nor greatness in mortality
  Can censure 'scape; backwounding calumny
  The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
  Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hamlet says to Ophelia:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shall
  not escape calumny.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And Laertes says that &ldquo;virtue itself&rdquo; cannot escape calumny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reflection is manifestly Shakespeare's own, and here the form, too, is
      characteristic. It may be as well to recall now that Shakespeare himself
      was calumniated in his lifetime; the fact is admitted in Sonnet 36, where
      he fears his &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; will &ldquo;shame&rdquo; his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his talk with Escalus the Duke's speech becomes almost obscure from
      excessive condensation of thought&mdash;a habit which grew upon
      Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Escalus asks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;What news abroad in the world?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Duke answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness,
  that the dissolution of it must cure it: novelty is only in
  request. ... There is scarce truth enough alive to make
  societies secure, but security enough to make fellowships
  accursed.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Escalus then tells us of the Duke's temperament in words which would fit
      Hamlet perfectly; for, curiously enough, they furnish us with the best
      description of Shakespeare's melancholy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
  anything which professed to make him rejoice.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And, lastly, the curious rhymed soliloquy of Vincentio which closes this
      third act, must be compared with the epilogue to &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;He who the sword of Heaven will bear
  Should be as holy as severe;
  Pattern in himself to know,
  Grace to stand and virtue go;&rdquo;
          - -        - -        - -        - -        - -
  &ldquo;Shame to him whose cruel striking
  Kills for faults of his own liking!
  Twice treble shame on Angelo,
  To weed my vice and let his grow!&rdquo;
          - -        - -        - -        - -        - -
</pre>
    <p>
      In the fifth act the Duke, freed from making plots and plans, speaks
      without constraint and reveals his nature ingenuously. He uses words to
      Angelo that recall the sonnets:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
  To lock it in the wards of covered bosom,
  When it deserves, with characters of brass,
  A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
  And razure of oblivion."{1}
</pre>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: Cf. Sonnet 122 with its &ldquo;full character'd&rdquo; and &ldquo;razed
      oblivion."}
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the Duke argues in gentle Shakespeare's fashion for Angelo and
      against Isabella:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    &ldquo;If he had so offended,
  He would have weighed thy brother by himself
  And not have cut him off.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It seems impossible for Shakespeare to believe that the sinner can punish
      sin. It reminds one of the sacred &ldquo;he that is without sin among you let
      him first cast a stone.&rdquo; The detections and forgivings of the last act
      follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be admitted, I think, on all hands that Duke Vincentio speaks
      throughout the play with Shakespeare's voice. From the point of view of
      literary art his character is very far from being as complex or as deeply
      realized as that of Hamlet or Macbeth, or even as that of Romeo or of
      Jaques, and yet one other trait besides that of sceptical brooding is so
      over-accentuated that it can never be forgotten. In the last scene the
      Duke orders Barnardine to the block and the next moment respites him; he
      condemns
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;An Angelo for Claudio; death for death,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      then pardons Angelo, and at once begins to chat with him in kindly
      intimacy; he asserts that he cannot forgive Lucio, Lucio who has traduced
      him, shall be whipped and hanged, and in the same breath he remits the
      heavy penalty. Truly he is &ldquo;an unhurtful opposite&rdquo; {Footnote: The critics
      are at variance over this ending, and, indeed, over the whole play.
      Coleridge says that &ldquo;our feelings of justice are grossly wounded in
      Angelo's escape&rdquo;; for &ldquo;cruelty with lust and damnable baseness cannot be
      forgiven.&rdquo; Mr. Swinburne, too, regrets the miscarriage of justice; the
      play to him is a tragedy, and should end tragically with the punishment of
      the &ldquo;autotype of the huge national vice of England.&rdquo; Perhaps, however,
      Puritan hypocrisy was not so widespread or so powerful in the time of
      Shakespeare as it is nowadays; perhaps, too, Shakespeare was not so good a
      hater as Mr. Swinburne, nor so strenuous a moralist as Coleridge was, at
      least in theory. In any case it is evident that Shakespeare found it
      harder to forgive Lucio, who had hurt his vanity, than Angelo, who pushed
      lust to outrage and murder, which strange, yet characteristic, fact I
      leave to the mercy of future commentators. Mr. Sidney Lee regards &ldquo;Measure
      for Measure&rdquo; as &ldquo;one of Shakespeare's greatest plays.&rdquo; Coleridge, however,
      thought it &ldquo;a hateful work&rdquo;; it is also a poor work, badly constructed,
      and for the most part carelessly written. In essence it is a mere tract
      against Puritanism, and in form a sort of Arabian Nights' Entertainment in
      which the hero plays the part of Haroun-al-Raschid.} whose anger has no
      stead-fastness; but the gentle forgivingness of disposition that is so
      marked in Vincentio is a trait we found emphasized in Romeo, and again in
      Hamlet and again in Macbeth. It is, indeed, one of the most permanent
      characteristics of Shakespeare. From the beginning to the end of the play,
      Duke Vincentio is weakly-kind in act and swayed by fitful impulses; his
      assumed austerity of conduct is the thin varnish of vanity that will not
      take on such soft material. The Hamlet weakness is so exaggerated in him,
      and so unmotived, that I am inclined to think Shakespeare was even more
      irresolute and indisposed to action than Hamlet himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the character of Posthumus, the hero of &ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo; Shakespeare has
      painted himself with extraordinary care; has, in fact, given us as
      deliberate and almost as complete a picture of himself as he did in
      Hamlet. Unluckily his hand had grown weaker in the ten years' interval,
      and he gave such loose rein to his idealizing habit that the portrait is
      neither so veracious nor so lifelike. The explanation of all this will be
      given later; it is enough for the moment to state that as Posthumus is
      perhaps the completest portrait of him that we have after his mental
      shipwreck, we must note the traits of it carefully, and see what manner of
      man Shakespeare took himself to be towards the end of his career.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to understand how the commentators have been able to read
      &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo; without seeing the likeness between Posthumus and Hamlet. The
      wager which is the theme of the play may have hindered them a little, but
      as they found it easy to excuse its coarseness by attributing lewdness to
      the time, there seems to have been no reason for not recognizing
      Posthumus. Posthumus is simply a staider Hamlet considerably idealized. I
      am not at all sure that the subject of the play was void of offence in the
      time of Elizabeth; all finer spirits must even then have found it puerile
      and coarse. What would Spenser have said about it? Shakespeare used the
      wager because of the opportunities it gave him of painting himself and an
      ideal woman. His view of it is just indicated; Iachimo says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation: and,
      to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the
      world.&rdquo; But in spite of the fact that Iachimo makes his insult general,
      Posthumus warns him that:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;If she remain unseduced ... for your ill opinion,
  and the assault you have made to her chastity, you shall
  answer me with your sword.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      From this it appears that the bet was distasteful to Posthumus; it is not
      so offenceful to him as it should have been according to our modern
      temper; but this shortcoming, an unconscious shortcoming, is the only
      fault which Shakespeare will allow in his hero. In the first scene of the
      first act Posthumus is praised as men never praise the absent without a
      personal motive; the First Gentleman says of him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                       &ldquo;I do not think
  So fair an outward and such stuff within
  Endows a man but he.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Second Gentleman replies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;You speak him far;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and the First Gentleman continues:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I do extend him, sir, within himself;
  Crush him together, rather than unfold
  His measure duly.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And as if this were not enough, this gentleman-eulogist goes on to tell us
      that Posthumus has sucked in &ldquo;all the learnings&rdquo; of his time &ldquo;as we do
      air,&rdquo; and further:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                            &ldquo;He lived in court&mdash;
  Which rare it is to do&mdash;most praised, most loved;
  A sample to the young'st, to the more mature
  A glass that feated them; and to the graver
  A child that guided dotards.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This gross praise is ridiculously unnatural, and outrages our knowledge of
      life; men are much more apt to criticize than to praise the absent; but it
      shows a prepossession on Shakespeare's part in favour of Posthumus which
      can only be explained by the fact that in Posthumus he was depicting
      himself. Every word is significant to us, for Shakespeare evidently tells
      us here what he thought about himself, or rather what he wished to think,
      towards the end of his life. It is impossible to believe that he was &ldquo;most
      praised, most loved&rdquo;; men do not love or praise their superiors in looks,
      or intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first words which Posthumus in this same scene addresses to Imogen,
      show the gentle Shakespeare nature:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
  To be suspected of more tenderness
  Than doth become a man.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And when Imogen gives him the ring and tells him to wear it till he woos
      another wife, he talks to her exactly as Romeo would have talked:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                        &ldquo;How! how! another?&mdash;
  You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
  And sear up my embracements from a next
  With bonds of death! {<i>Putting on the ring</i>.}
                       Remain, remain thou here
  While sense can keep it on.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And he concludes as self-depreciating Hamlet would have concluded:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  &ldquo;And sweetest, fairest,
  As I my poor self did exchange for you,
  To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
  I still win of you; for my sake wear this:
  It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
  Upon this fairest prisoner.
    {Putting a bracelet on her arm.}&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In his fight with Cloten he is depicted as a rare swordsman of wonderful
      magnanimity. Pisanio says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;My master rather played than fought,
  And had no help of anger.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I call this gentle kindness which Posthumus displays, the birthmark of
      Shakespeare; he had &ldquo;no help of anger.&rdquo; As the play goes on we find
      Shakespeare's other peculiarities, or Hamlet's. Iachimo represents
      Posthumus as &ldquo;merry,&rdquo; &ldquo;gamesome,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Briton reveller&rdquo;; but curiously
      enough Imogen answers as Ophelia might have answered about Hamlet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;When he was here,
  He did incline to sadness; and ofttimes
  Not knowing why.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This uncaused melancholy that distinguishes Romeo, Jaques, Hamlet,
      Macbeth, and Vincentio is not more characteristic of the
      Hamlet-Shakespeare nature than the way Posthumus behaves when Iachimo
      tries to make him believe that he has won the wager. Posthumus is
      convinced almost at once; jumps to the conclusion, indeed, with the
      heedless rapidity of the naïve, sensitive, quick-thinking man who has
      cultivated his emotions and thoughts by writing in solitude, and not the
      suspicions and distrust of others which are developed in the market-place.
      One is reminded of Goethe's famous couplet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Es bildet ein Talent sich in der Stille,
  Sich ein Charakter in dem Strom der Welt.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Posthumus is all in fitful extremes; not satisfied with believing the lie,
      he gives Iachimo Imogen's ring as well, and bursts into a diatribe:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Let there be no honour
  Where there's beauty; truth, where semblance; love,
  Where there's another man,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and so forth. Even Philario, who has no stake in the matter, is infinitely
      harder to convince:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Have patience, sir,
  And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:
  It may be probable she lost it.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then this &ldquo;unstable opposite,&rdquo; Posthumus, demands his ring back again, but
      as soon as Iachimo swears that he had the bracelet from her arm, Posthumus
      swings round again to belief from sheer rapidity of thought. Again
      Philario will not be convinced. He says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Sir, be patient,
  This is not strong enough to be believed
  Of one persuaded well of&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But Posthumus will not await the proof for which he has asked. He is
      convinced upon suspicion, as Othello was, and the very nimbleness of his
      Hamlet-intellect, seeing that probabilities are against him, entangles him
      in the snare. Even his servant Pisanio will not believe in Imogen's guilt
      though his master assures him of it. Shakespeare does not notice this
      peculiar imprudent haste of his hero, as he notices, for example, the
      hasty speech of Hotspur by letting Harry of England imitate it, simply
      because the quick-thinking was his own; while the hurried stuttering
      speech was foreign to him. Posthumus goes on to rave against women as
      Hamlet did; as all men do who do not understand them:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;For even to vice
  They are not constant, but are changing still.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And Posthumus betrays as clearly as ever Hamlet did that he is merely
      Shakespeare masquerading:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                        &ldquo;I'll write against them,
  Detest them, curse them&mdash;yet 'tis greater skill
  In a true hate, to pray they have their will:
  The very devils cannot plague them better.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write against them&rdquo; indeed! This is the same threat which Shakespeare
      uses against his dark mistress in Sonnet 140, and every one will admit
      that it is more in the character of the poet and man of letters than in
      that of the warrior son-in-law of a half-barbarous king. The last line
      here, because it is a little superfluous, a little emphatic, seems to me
      likely to have a personal application. When Shakespeare's mistress had her
      will, did she fall to misery, I wonder?
    </p>
    <p>
      I may be allowed to notice here how intensely characteristic all this play
      is of Shakespeare. In the third scene of the third act, life in the
      country is contrasted to its advantage with life at Court; and then gold
      is treated as dirt by the princely brothers&mdash;both these, the love of
      country life, and the contempt of gold, are, as we shall see later,
      abiding peculiarities of Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we come to Posthumus again almost at the end of the play we find that
      his anger with Imogen has burned itself out. He is angry now with Pisanio
      for having executed his order and murdered her; he should have &ldquo;saved the
      noble Imogen to repent.&rdquo; Surely the poet Shakespeare and not the outraged
      lover speaks in this epithet, &ldquo;noble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Posthumus describes the battle in which he took so gallant a part in
      Shakespeare's usual manner. He falls into rhyme; he shows the cheap
      modesty of the conventional hero; he tells of what others did, and nothing
      of his own feats; Belarius and the two striplings, he says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;With their own nobleness ... gilded pale looks.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Unfortunately one is reminded of the exquisite sonnet line:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gild&rdquo; is one of Shakespeare's favourite words; he uses it very often,
      sometimes indeed as in this case, ineffectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the scene which reveals the character of Posthumus beyond all doubt is
      the prison scene in the fifth act. His soliloquy which begins:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Most welcome, bondage, for thou art a way,
  I think, to liberty &ldquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      is all pure Shakespeare. When he determines to give up life, he says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                          &ldquo;O Imogen!
  I'll speak to thee in silence,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and Hamlet at his death comes to the self-same word:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The rest is silence.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The scene with the gaoler is from Hamlet's soul; Posthumus jests with his
      keeper as Hamlet with the gravedigger:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the
  ship pays the shot;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and the Hamlet melancholy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am merrier to die than them art to live;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and the Hamlet riddle still unsolved:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct
  them the way I am going; but such as wink, and will
  not use them.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When the messenger comes to bring him to the king, Posthumus cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thou bringest good news, I am called to be made
  free,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      for there are &ldquo;no bolts for the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who wish to see how Shakespeare's mind worked will compare
      Posthumus' speech to Iachimo, when he has learned the truth, with
      Othello's words when he is convinced of his own fatal error and of
      Desdemona's chastity. The two speeches are twins; though the persons
      uttering them should be of totally different characters. The explanation
      of this astounding similarity will be given when we come to &ldquo;Othello.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is characteristic of Posthumus that he should strike Imogen in her
      page's dress, not recognizing her; he is ever too quick&mdash;a mere
      creature of impulse. More characteristic still is the way he forgives
      Iachimo, just as Vincentio forgave Angelo:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Kneel not to me:
  The power that I have on you, is to spare you,
  The malice towards you, to forgive you. Live,
  And deal with others better.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In judging his fellow-men this is Shakespeare's harshest word. Posthumus,
      then, is presented to us in the beginning of the play as perfect, a model
      to young and old, of irreproachable virtue and of all wonderful qualities.
      In the course of the play, however, he shows himself very nimble-witted,
      credulous, and impulsive, quick to anger and quicker still to forgive;
      with thoughts all turned to sadness and to musing; a poet&mdash;ever in
      extremes; now hating his own rash errors to the point of demanding the
      heaviest punishment for them; now swearing that he will revenge himself on
      women by writing against them; a philosopher&mdash;he jests with his
      gaoler and consoles himself with despairing speculation in the very
      presence of the Arch-Fear. All these are manifestly characteristics of
      Hamlet, and Posthumus possesses no others.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, then, from finding that Shakespeare never revealed himself in his
      dramas, I have shown that he pictured himself as the hero {Footnote: A
      hypercritic might contend that Jaques was not the hero of &ldquo;As You Like
      It&rdquo;; but the objection really strengthens my argument. Shakespeare makes
      of Jaques, who is merely a secondary character without influence on the
      action, the principal person in the play simply because in Jaques he
      satisfied his own need of self-revealing.} of six plays written at widely
      different times; in fact that, like Rembrandt, he painted his own portrait
      in all the critical periods of life: as a sensuous youth given over to
      love and poetry in Romeo; a few years later as a melancholy onlooker at
      life's pageant in Jaques; in middle age as the passionate, melancholy,
      aesthete-philosopher of kindliest nature in Hamlet and Macbeth; as the
      fitful Duke incapable of severity in &ldquo;Measure for Measure,&rdquo; and finally,
      when standing within the shadow, as Posthumus, an idealized yet feebler <i>replica</i>
      of Hamlet.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. SHAKESPEARE'S MEN OF ACTION: THE BASTARD, ARTHUR, AND KING
      RICHARD II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is time now, I think, to test my theory by considering the converse of
      it. In any case, the attempt to see the other side, is pretty sure to make
      for enlightenment, and may thus justify itself. In the mirror which
      Shakespeare held up to human nature, we not only see Romeo, and Jaques,
      Hamlet, Macbeth and Posthumus; but also the leonine, frank face of the
      Bastard, the fiery, lean, impatient mask of Hotspur, and the cynical, bold
      eyes of Richard III. Even if it were admitted that Shakespeare preferred
      the type of the poet-philosopher, he was certainly able, one would say, to
      depict the man of action with extraordinary vigour and success. He himself
      then must have possessed a certain strength of character, certain
      qualities of decision and courage; he must have had, at least, &ldquo;a good
      stroke in him,&rdquo; as Carlyle phrased it. This is the universal belief, a
      belief sanctioned by Coleridge and Goethe, and founded apparently on plain
      facts, and yet, I think, it is mistaken, demonstrably untrue. It might
      even be put more plausibly than any of its defenders has put it. One might
      point out that Shakespeare's men of action are nearly all to be found in
      the historical plays which he wrote in early manhood, while the portrait
      of the philosopher-poet is the favourite study of his riper years. It
      would then be possible to suggest that Shakespeare grew from a bold
      roistering youth into a melancholy, thoughtful old age, touching both
      extremes of manhood in his own development. But even this comforting
      explanation will not stand: his earliest impersonations are all thinkers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us consider, again, how preference in a writer is established.
      Everyone feels that Sophocles prefers Antigone to Ismene; Ismene is a mere
      sketch of gentle feminine weakness; while Antigone is a great portrait of
      the <i>revoltée</i>, the first appearance indeed in literature of the &ldquo;new
      woman,&rdquo; and the place she fills in the drama, and the ideal qualities
      attributed to her girlhood&mdash;alike betray the personal admiration of
      the poet. In the same way Shakespeare's men of action are mere sketches in
      comparison with the intimate detailed portrait of the
      aesthete-philosopher-poet with his sensuous, gentle, melancholy
      temperament. Moreover, and this should be decisive, Shakespeare's men of
      action are all taken from history, or tradition, or story, and not from
      imagination, and their characteristics were supplied by the chroniclers
      and not invented by the dramatist. To see how far this is true I must
      examine Shakespeare's historical plays at some length Such an examination
      did not form a part of my original purpose. It is very difficult, not to
      say impossible, to ascertain exactly how far history and verbal tradition
      helped Shakespeare in his historical portraits of English worthies.
      Jaques, for instance, is his own creation from top to toe; every word
      given to him therefore deserves careful study; but how much of Hotspur is
      Shakespeare's, and how much of the Bastard? Without pretending, however,
      to define exactly the sources or the limits of the master's inspiration,
      there are certain indications in the historical plays which throw a flood
      of light on the poet's nature, and certain plain inferences from his
      methods which it would be folly not to draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us begin with &ldquo;King John,&rdquo; as one of the easiest and most helpful to
      us at this stage, and remembering that Shakespeare's drama was evidently
      founded on the old play entitled &ldquo;The Troublesome Raigne of King John,&rdquo;
       let us from our knowledge of Shakespeare's character forecast what his
      part in the work must have been. A believer in the theory I have set forth
      would guess at once that the strong, manly character of the Bastard was
      vigorously sketched even in the old play, and just as surely one would
      attribute the gentle, feminine, pathetic character of Arthur to
      Shakespeare. And this is precisely what we find: Philip Fauconbridge is
      excellently depicted in the old play; he is called:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A hardy wildehead, tough and venturous,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and he talks and acts the character to the life. In &ldquo;The Troublesome
      Raigne,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;King John,&rdquo; he is proud of his true father, the
      lion-hearted Richard, and careless of the stain of his illegitimate birth;
      he cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;The world 's in my debt,
  There's something owing to Plantaginet.
  I, marrie Sir, let me alone for game
  He act some wonders now I know my name;
  By blessed Marie He not sell that pride
  For England's wealth and all the world beside.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Who does not feel the leaping courage and hardihood of the Bastard in
      these lines? Shakespeare seizes the spirit of the character and renders
      it, but his emendations are all by way of emphasis: he does not add a new
      quality; his Bastard is the Bastard of &ldquo;The Troublesome Raigne.&rdquo; But the
      gentle, pathetic character of Arthur is all Shakespeare's. In the old play
      Arthur is presented as a prematurely wise youth who now urges the claims
      of his descent and speaks boldly for his rights, and now begs his vixenish
      mother to
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Wisely winke at all
  Least further harmes ensue our hasty speech.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again, he consoles her with the same prudence:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Seasons will change and so our present griefe
  May change with them and all to our reliefe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This Arthur is certainly nothing like Shakespeare's Arthur. Shakespeare,
      who had just lost his only son Hamnet, {Footnote: Some months before
      writing &ldquo;King John&rdquo; Shakespeare had visited Stratford for the first time
      after ten years absence and had then perhaps learned to know and love
      young Hamnet.} in his twelfth year, turns Arthur from a young man into a
      child, and draws all the pathos possible from his weakness and suffering;
      Arthur's first words are of &ldquo;his powerless hand,&rdquo; and his advice to his
      mother reaches the very fount of tears:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Good my mother, peace!
  I would that I were low laid in my grave;
  I am not worth this coil that's made for me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When taken prisoner his thought is not of himself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, this will make my mother die with grief.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He is a woman-child in unselfish sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the exquisitely pathetic scene between Hubert and Arthur
      belongs, as one might have guessed, to Shakespeare, that is, the whole
      pathos of it belongs to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the old play Arthur thanks Hubert for his care, calls him &ldquo;curteous
      keeper,&rdquo; and, in fact, behaves as the conventional prince. He has no words
      of such affecting appeal as Shakespeare puts into Arthur's mouth:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                        &ldquo;I would to heaven
  I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This love and longing for love is the characteristic of Shakespeare's
      Arthur; he goes on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale to-day.
  In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
  That I might sit all night and watch with you:
  I warrant, I love you more than you do me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A girl could not be more tender, more anxious for love's assurance. In
      &ldquo;The Troublesome Raigne,&rdquo; when Hubert tells Arthur that he has bad news
      for him, tidings of &ldquo;more hate than death,&rdquo; Arthur faces the unknown with
      a man's courage; he asks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;What is it, man? if needes be don,
  Act it, and end it, that the paine were gon.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It might be the Bastard speaking, so hardy-reckless are the words. When
      this Arthur pleads for his eyesight, he does it in this way:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I speake not only for eyes priviledge,
  The chiefe exterior that I would enjoy:
  But for thy perill, farre beyond my paine,
  Thy sweete soules losse more than my eyes vaine lack.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again at the end he says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Delay not, Hubert, my orisons are ended,
  Begin I pray thee, reave me of my sight.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And when Hubert relents because his &ldquo;conscience bids him desist,&rdquo; Arthur
      says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Hubert, if ever Arthur be in state
  Looke for amends of this received gift.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In all this there is neither realization of character nor even sincere
      emotion. But Shakespeare's Arthur is a masterpiece of soul-revealing, and
      moves us to pity at every word:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             &ldquo;Will you put out mine eyes?
  These eyes that never did, nor never shall,
  So much as frown on you?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then the child's imaginative horror of being bound:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;For heaven's sake, Hubert, let me not be bound.
  Nay, hear me, Hubert: drive these men away,
  And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
  I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When Hubert relents, Shakespeare's Arthur does not promise reward, he
      simply breathes a sigh of exquisite affection:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, now you look like Hubert: all this while
  You were disguised.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And finally, when Hubert promises never to hurt him, his words are:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Arthur's character we owe entirely to Shakespeare, there is no hint of his
      weakness and tenderness in the original, no hint either of the pathos of
      his appeal&mdash;these are the inventions of gentle Shakespeare, who has
      manifestly revealed his own exceeding tenderness and sweetness of heart in
      the person of the child Prince. Of course, there are faults in the work;
      faults of affectation and word-conceit hardly to be endured. When Hubert
      says he will burn out his eyes with hot irons, Arthur replies:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, none, but in this iron age, would do it! The iron of itself, though
      heat red-hot,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      and so forth. ... Nor does this passage of tinsel stand alone. When the
      iron cools and Hubert says he can revive it, Arthur replies with pinchbeck
      conceits:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An if you do you will but make it blush, And glow with shame at your
      proceedings,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      and so forth. The faults are bad enough; but the heavenly virtues carry
      them all off triumphantly. There is no creation like Arthur in the whole
      realm of poetry; he is all angelic love and gentleness, and yet neither
      mawkish nor unnatural; his fears make him real to us, and the horror of
      his situation allows us to accept his exquisite pleading as possible. We
      need only think of Tennyson's May Queen, or of his unspeakable Arthur, or
      of Thackeray's prig Esmond, in order to understand how difficult it is in
      literature to make goodness attractive or even credible. Yet Shakespeare's
      art triumphs where no one else save Balzac and Tourgenief has achieved
      even a half-success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot leave this play without noticing that Shakespeare has shown in it
      a hatred of murder just as emphatically as he has revealed his love of
      gentleness and pity in the creation of Arthur. In spite of the loyalty
      which the English nobles avow in the second scene of the fourth act, which
      is a quality that always commends itself to Shakespeare, Pembroke is
      merely their mouthpiece in requesting the King to &ldquo;enfranchise Arthur.&rdquo; As
      soon as John tells them that Arthur is dead they throw off their
      allegiance and insult the monarch to his face. Even John is startled by
      their indignation, and brought as near remorse as is possible for him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;I repent;
  There is no sure foundation set on blood;
  No certain life achieved by others' death&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;which reads like a reflection of Shakespeare himself. When the
      Bastard asks the nobles to return to their allegiance, Salisbury finds an
      astonishing phrase to express their loathing of the crime:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The King hath dispossess'd himself of us;
  We will not line his thin bestained cloak
  With our pure honours, <i>nor attend the foot
  That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks</i>.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In all literature there is no more terrible image: Shakespeare's horror of
      bloodshed has more than Aeschylean intensity. When the dead body of Arthur
      is found each of the nobles in turn expresses his abhorrence of the deed,
      and all join in vowing instant revenge. Even the Bastard calls it
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A damned and bloody work,
  The graceless action of a heavy hand,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and a little later the thought of the crime brings even this tough
      adventurer to weakness:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way
  Among the thorns and dangers of this world.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;a phrase that suits the weakness of Richard II. or Henry VI. or
      Shakespeare himself better than it suits the hardy Bastard. Even as a
      young man Shakespeare hated the cruelty of ambition and the savagery of
      war as much as he loved all the ceremonies of chivalry and observances of
      gentle courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very similar inferences are to be drawn from a study of Shakespeare's
      &ldquo;King Richard II.,&rdquo; which in some respects is his most important
      historical creation. Coleridge says: &ldquo;I know of no character drawn by our
      great poet with such unequalled skill as that of Richard II.&rdquo; Such praise
      is extravagant; but it would have been true to say that up to 1593 or
      1594, when Shakespeare wrote &ldquo;King Richard II.,&rdquo; he had given us no
      character so complex and so interesting as this Richard. Coleridge
      overpraised the character-drawing probably because the study of Richard's
      weakness and irresolution, and the pathos resulting from such
      helplessness, must have seemed very like an analysis of his own nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now examine &ldquo;Richard II.,&rdquo; and see what light it casts on
      Shakespeare's qualities. There was an old play of the same title, a play
      which is now lost, but we can form some idea of what it was like from the
      description in Forman's Diary. Like most of the old history-plays it
      ranged over twenty years of Richard's reign, whereas Shakespeare's tragedy
      is confined to the last year of Richard's life. It is probable that the
      old play presented King Richard as more wicked and more deceitful than
      Shakespeare imagines him. We know that in the &ldquo;Confessio Amantis,&rdquo; Gower,
      the poet, cast off his allegiance to Richard: for he cancelled the
      dedication of the poem to Richard, and dedicated it instead to Henry.
      William Langland, too, the author of the &ldquo;Vision of Piers Plowman,&rdquo; turned
      from Richard at the last, and used his deposition as a warning to
      ill-advised youth. It may be assumed, then, that tradition pictured
      Richard as a vile creature in whom weakness nourished crime. Shakespeare
      took his story partly from Holinshed's narrative, and partly either from
      the old play or from the traditional view of Richard's character. When he
      began to write the play he evidently intended to portray Richard as even
      more detestable than history and tradition had presented him. In Holinshed
      Richard is not accused of the murder of Gloster, whereas Shakespeare
      directly charges him with it, or rather makes Gaunt do so, and the
      accusation is not denied, much less disproved. At the close of the first
      act we are astonished by the revelation of Richard's devilish
      heartlessness. The King hearing that his uncle, John of Gaunt, is
      &ldquo;grievous sick,&rdquo; cries out:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Now put it, God, in his physician's mind,
  To help him to his grave immediately!
  The lining of his coffers shall make coats
  To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
  Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
  Pray God we may make haste and come too late.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This mixture of greed and cold cruelty decked out with blasphemous phrase
      is viler, I think, than anything attributed by Shakespeare to the worst of
      his villains. But surely some hint of Richard's incredible vileness should
      have come earlier in the play, should have preceded at least his
      banishment of Bolingbroke, if Shakespeare had really meant to present him
      to us in this light.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first scene of the second act, when Gaunt reproves him, Richard
      turns on him in a rage, threatening. In the very same scene York reproves
      Richard for seizing Gaunt's money and land, and Richard retorts:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Think what you will: we seize into our hands
  His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But when York blames him to his face and predicts that evil will befall
      him and leaves him, Richard in spite of this at once creates:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Our uncle York, Lord Governor of England;
  For he is just, and always loved us well.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This Richard of Shakespeare is so far, I submit, almost incomprehensible.
      When reproved by Gaunt and warned, Richard rages and threatens; when
      blamed by York much more severely, Richard rewards York: the two scenes
      contradict each other. Moreover, though his callous selfishness, greed and
      cruelty are apparently established, in the very next scene of this act our
      sympathy with Richard is called forth by the praise his queen gives him.
      She says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;I know no cause
  Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
  Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
  As my sweet Richard.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And from this scene to the end of the play Shakespeare enlists all our
      sympathy for Richard. Now, what is the reason of this right-about-face on
      the part of the poet?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
It appears to me that Shakespeare began the play intending to present
the vile and cruel Richard of tradition. But midway in the play he saw
that there was no emotion, no pathos, to be got out of the traditional
view. If Richard were a vile, scheming, heartless murderer, the loss of
his crown and life would merely satisfy our sense of justice, but this
outcome did not satisfy Shakespeare's desire for emotion, and
particularly his desire for pathos, {Footnote: In the last scene of the
last act of &ldquo;Lear,&rdquo; Albany says:
  &ldquo;This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble
  Touches us not with pity."}
and accordingly he veers round, says nothing more of Richard's
vileness, lays stress upon his weakness and sufferings, discovers, too,
all manner of amiable qualities in him, and so draws pity from us for
his dethronement and murder.
</pre>
    <p>
      The curious thing is that while Shakespeare is depicting Richard's
      heartlessness, he does his work badly; the traits, as I have shown, are
      crudely extravagant and even contradictory; but when he paints Richard's
      gentleness and amiability, he works like a master, every touch is
      infallible: he is painting himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural for Shakespeare to sympathize deeply with Richard; he was
      still young when he wrote the play, young enough to remember vividly how
      he himself had been led astray by loose companions, and this formed a bond
      between them. At this time of his life this was Shakespeare's favourite
      subject: he treated it again in &ldquo;Henry IV.,&rdquo; which is at once the epilogue
      to &ldquo;Richard II.&rdquo; and a companion picture to it; for the theme of both
      plays is the same&mdash;youth yielding to unworthy companions&mdash;though
      the treatment in the earlier play is incomparably feebler than it became
      in &ldquo;King Henry IV.&rdquo; Bushy, Bagot, and Green, the favourites of Richard,
      are not painted as Shakespeare afterwards painted Falstaff and his
      followers. But partly because he had not yet attained to such objective
      treatment of character, Shakespeare identified himself peculiarly with
      Richard; and his painting of Richard is more intimate, more subtle, more
      self-revealing and pathetic than anything in &ldquo;Henry IV.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I have already said, from the time when Richard appoints York as
      Regent, and leaves England, Shakespeare begins to think of himself as
      Richard, and from this moment to the end no one can help sympathizing with
      the unhappy King. At this point, too, the character-drawing becomes, of a
      sudden, excellent. When Richard lands in England, he is given speech after
      speech, and all he says and does afterwards throws light, it seems to me,
      on Shakespeare's own nature. Let us mark each trait First of all Richard
      is intensely, frankly emotional: he &ldquo;weeps for joy&rdquo; to be in England
      again; &ldquo;weeping, smiling,&rdquo; he greets the earth of England, and is full of
      hope. &ldquo;The thief, the traitor,&rdquo; Bolingbroke, will not dare to face the
      light of the sun; for &ldquo;every man that Bolingbroke has in his pay,&rdquo; he
      cries exultantly, God hath given Richard a &ldquo;glorious angel; ... Heaven
      still guards the right.&rdquo; A moment later he hears from Salisbury that the
      Welshmen whom he had relied upon as allies are dispersed and fled. At once
      he becomes &ldquo;pale and dead.&rdquo; From the height of pride and confidence he
      falls to utter hopelessness.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;All souls that will be safe fly from my side;
  For time hath set a blot upon my pride.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Aumerle asks him to remember who he is, and at once he springs from
      dejection to confidence again. He cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Awake, thou sluggard majesty! thou sleepest.
  Is not the king's name forty thousand names?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The next moment Scroop speaks of cares, and forthwith fitful Richard is in
      the dumps once more. But this time his weakness is turned to resignation
      and sadness, and the pathos of this is brought out by the poet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
  Greater he shall not be; if he serve God
  We'll serve him, too, and be his fellow so.
  Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
  They break their faith to God, as well as us.
  Cry woe, destruction, ruin, loss, decay;
  The worst is death, and death will have his day.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Who does not hear Hamlet speaking in this memorable last line? Like
      Hamlet, too, this Richard is quick to suspect even his friends' loyalty.
      He guesses that Bagot, Bushy, and Green have made peace with Bolingbroke,
      and when Scroop seems to admit this, Richard is as quick as Hamlet to
      unpack his heart with words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O villains, vipers, damned without redemption!
  Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
  Snakes,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as he learns that his friends are dead he breaks out in a long
      lament for them which ranges over everything from worms to kings, and in
      its melancholy pessimism is the prototype of those meditations which
      Shakespeare has put in the mouth of nearly all his favourite characters.
      Who is not reminded of Hamlet's great monologue when he reads:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;For within the hollow crown,
  That rounds the mortal temples of a king,
  Keeps Death his court: and there the antic sits
  Scoffing his state, and grinning at his pomp;
  Allowing him a breath, a little scene
  To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks;
  Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
  As if this flesh, which walls about our life,
  Were brass impregnable; and, humour'd thus,
  Comes at the last, and with a little pin{1}
  Bores through his castle wall, and&mdash;farewell, King!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: In Hamlet's famous soliloquy the pin is a &ldquo;bodkin."}
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take another two lines of this soliloquy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
  And tell sad stories of the death of kings.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the second scene of the third act of &ldquo;Titus Andronicus&rdquo; we find Titus
      saying to his daughter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee
  Sad stories chancèd in the times of old.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again, in the &ldquo;Comedy of Errors,&rdquo; Ægeon tells us that his life was
      prolonged:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The similarity of these passages shows that in the very spring of life and
      heyday of the blood Shakespeare had in him a certain romantic melancholy
      which was developed later by the disappointments of life into the
      despairing of Macbeth and Lear.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Bishop calls upon Richard to act, the King's weathercock mind
      veers round again, and he cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;This ague fit of fear is over-blown,
  An easy task it is to win our own.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But when Scroop tells him that York has joined with Bolingbroke, he
      believes him at once, gives up hope finally, and turns as if for comfort
      to his own melancholy fate:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
  Of that sweet way I was in to despair!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;sweet way&rdquo; of despair is Romeo's way, Hamlet's, Macbeth's and
      Shakespeare's way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next scene Richard meets his foes, and at first plays the king.
      Shakespeare tells us that he looks like a king, that his eyes are as
      &ldquo;bright as an eagle's&rdquo;; and this poetic admiration of state and place
      seems to have got into Richard's blood, for at first he declares that
      Bolingbroke is guilty of treason, and asserts that:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My master, God omnipotent,
  Is mustering in his clouds, on our behalf,
  Armies of pestilence.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Of course, he gives in with fair words the next moment, and the next rages
      against Bolingbroke; and then comes the great speech in which the poet
      reveals himself so ingenuously that at the end of it the King he pretends
      to be, has to admit that he has talked but idly. I cannot help
      transcribing the whole of the passage, for it shows how easily Shakespeare
      falls out of this King's character into his own:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;What must the King do now? Must he submit?
  The King shall do it. Must he be depos'd?
  The King shall be contented: must he lose
  The name of king? O! God's name, let it go:
  I'll give my jewels for a set of beads;
  My gorgeous palace for a hermitage;
  My gay apparel for an alms-man's gown;
  My figur'd goblets for a dish of wood;
  My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff;
  My subjects for a pair of carved saints;
  And my large kingdom for a little grave,
  A little, little grave, an obscure grave:&mdash;
  Or I'll be buried in the King's highway,
  Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
  May hourly trample on their sovereign's head:
  For on my heart they tread, now whilst I live;
  And, buried once, why not upon my head?&mdash;
  Aumerle, thou weep'st; my tender-hearted cousin!&mdash;
  We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
  Our sighs, and they, shall lodge the summer corn,
  And make a dearth in this revolting land.
  Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
  And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
  As thus:&mdash;To drop them still upon one place,
  Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
  Within the earth; and, therein laid,&mdash;There lies
  Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
  Would not this ill do well?&mdash;Well, well, I see
  I talk but idly, and you mock at me.&mdash;
  Most mighty prince, my lord Northumberland,
  What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
  Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
  You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Every one will admit that the poet himself speaks here, at least, from the
      words &ldquo;I'll give my jewels&rdquo; to the words &ldquo;Would not this ill do well?&rdquo; But
      the melancholy mood, the pathetic acceptance of the inevitable, the tender
      poetic embroidery now suit the King who is fashioned in the poet's
      likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Richard revolts once more against his fate:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Base court, where kings grow base,
  To come at traitors' calls, and do them grace.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And when Bolingbroke kneels to him he plays upon words, as Gaunt did a
      little earlier in the play misery making sport to mock itself. He says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
  Thus high at least, although your knee be low&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      and then he abandons himself to do &ldquo;what force will have us do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Queen's wretchedness is next used to heighten our sympathy with
      Richard, and immediately afterwards we have that curious scene between the
      gardener and his servant which is merely youthful Shakespeare, for such a
      gardener and such a servant never yet existed. The scene {Footnote:
      Coleridge gives this scene as an instance of Shakespeare's &ldquo;wonderful
      judgement&rdquo;; the introduction of the gardener, he says, &ldquo;realizes the
      thing,&rdquo; and, indeed, the introduction of a gardener would have this
      tendency, but not the introduction of this pompous, priggish philosopher
      togged out in old Adam's likeness. Here is the way this gardener
      criticises the King:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;All superfluous branches
  We lop away, that bearing boughs may live;
  Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
  Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down."}
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
shows the extravagance of Shakespeare's love of hierarchy, and shows
also that his power of realizing character is as yet but slight. The
abdication follows, when Richard in exquisite speech after speech
unpacks his heavy heart. To the very last his irresolution comes to show
as often as his melancholy. Bolingbroke is sharply practical:
  &ldquo;Are you contented to resign the crown?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Richard answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ay, no; no, ay;&mdash;for I must nothing be;
  Therefore, no, no, for I resign to thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When he is asked to confess his sins in public, he moves us all to pity:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Must I do so? and must I ravel out
  My weaved up follies? Gentle Northumberland,
  If thy offences were upon record,
  Would it not shame thee, in so fair a troop,
  To read a lecture of them?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      His eyes are too full of tears to read his own faults, and sympathy brings
      tears to our eyes also. Richard calls for a glass wherein to see his sins,
      and we are reminded of Hamlet, who advises the players to hold the mirror
      up to nature. He jests with his grief, too, in quick-witted retort, as
      Hamlet jests:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Rich. Say that again.
  The shadow of my sorrow? Ha! let's see:&mdash;
  'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
  And these external manners of lament
  Are merely shadows to the unseen grief,
  That swells with silence in the tortur'd soul.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hamlet touches the self-same note:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
  Nor customary suits of solemn black,
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  But I have that within which passeth show;
  These but the trappings and the suits of woe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the fifth act, the scene between the Queen and Richard is used simply
      to move our pity. She says he is &ldquo;most beauteous,&rdquo; but all too mild, and
      he answers her:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;I am sworn brother, sweet,
  To grim necessity; and he and I
  Will keep a league till death.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He bids her take,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;As from my death-bed, my last living leave,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and for her consolation he turns again to the telling of romantic
      melancholy stories:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;In winter's tedious nights, sit by the fire
  With good old folks; and let them tell thee tales
  Of woeful ages long ago betid:
  And, ere thou bid good night, to quit their grief,
  Tell thou the lamentable fall of me,
  And send the hearers weeping to their beds,
  For why; the senseless brands will sympathize
  The heavy accent of thy moving tongue.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I cannot copy this passage without drawing attention to the haunting music
      of the third line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene in which York betrays his son to Bolingbroke and prays the king
      not to pardon but &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; the offending member, is merely a proof, if
      proof were wanted, of Shakespeare's admiration of kingship and loyalty,
      which in youth, at least, often led him to silliest extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dungeon scene and Richard's monologue in it are as characteristic of
      Shakespeare as the similar scene in &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo; and the soliloquy of
      Posthumus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>K. Rich</i>., I have been studying how I may compare
  This prison where I live unto the world:
  And for because the world is populous,
  And here is not a creature but myself,
  I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out,
  My brain I'll prove the female to my soul
  My soul the father; and these two beget
  A generation of still breeding thoughts,
  And these same thoughts people this little world,
  In humours like the people of this world,
  For no thought is contented....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here we have the philosopher playing with his own thoughts; but soon the
      Hamlet-melancholy comes to tune the meditation to sadness, and Shakespeare
      speaks to us directly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thus play I in one person many people,
  And none contented: sometimes am I king;
  Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
  And so I am: then crushing penury
  Persuades me I was better when a king;
  Then am I king'd again; and by and by
  Think, that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
  And straight am nothing; but whate'er I be,
  Nor I nor any man that but man is
  With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
  With being nothing.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Later, one hears Kent's lament for Lear in Richard's words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    &ldquo;How these vain weak nails
  May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
  Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      To Richard music is &ldquo;sweet music,&rdquo; as it is to all the characters that are
      <i>merely</i> Shakespeare's masks, and the scene in which Hamlet asks
      Guildenstern to &ldquo;play upon the pipe&rdquo; is prefigured for us in Richard's
      self-reproach:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And here have I the daintiness of ear,
  To check time broke in a disordered string;
  But for the concord of my state and time,
  Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the last three lines of this monologue which I am now about to quote, I
      can hear Shakespeare speaking as plainly as he spoke in Arthur's appeals;
      the feminine longing for love is the unmistakable note:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
  For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
  Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And at the last, by killing the servant who assaults him, this Richard
      shows that he has the &ldquo;something desperate&rdquo; in him of which Hamlet
      boasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murderer's praise that this irresolute-weak and loving Richard is &ldquo;as
      full of valour as of royal blood&rdquo; is nothing more than an excellent
      instance of Shakespeare's self-illusion. He comes nearer the fact in
      &ldquo;Measure for Measure,&rdquo; where the Duke, his other self, is shown to be &ldquo;an
      unhurtful opposite&rdquo; too gentle-kind to remember an injury or punish the
      offender, and he rings the bell at truth's centre when, in &ldquo;Julius
      Caesar,&rdquo; his mask Brutus admits that he
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;... carries anger as the flint bears fire
  Who much enforcèd shows a hasty spark
  And straight is cold again.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      If a hasty blow were proof of valour then Walter Scott's Eachin in &ldquo;The
      Fair Maid of Perth&rdquo; would be called brave. But courage to be worth the
      name must be founded on stubborn resolution, and all Shakespeare's
      incarnations, and in especial this Richard, are as unstable as water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole play is summed up in York's pathetic description of Richard's
      entrance into London:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;No man cried, God save him;
  No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
  But dust was thrown upon his sacred head;
  Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off&mdash;
  His face still combating with tears and smiles,
  The badges of his grief and patience&mdash;
  That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
  The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,
  And barbarism itself have pitied him.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This passage it seems to me both in manner and matter is as truly
      characteristic of Shakespeare as any that can be found in all his works:
      his loving pity for the fallen, his passionate sympathy with &ldquo;gentle
      sorrow&rdquo; were never more perfectly expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pity, indeed, is the note of the tragedy, as it was in the Arthur-scenes
      in &ldquo;King John,&rdquo; but the knowledge of Shakespeare derived from &ldquo;King John&rdquo;
       is greatly widened by the study of &ldquo;King Richard II.&rdquo; In the Arthur of
      &ldquo;King John&rdquo; we found Shakespeare's exquisite pity for weakness, his
      sympathy with suffering, and, more than all, his girlish-tender love and
      desire of love. In &ldquo;Richard II.,&rdquo; the weakness Shakespeare pities is not
      physical weakness, but mental irresolution and incapacity for action, and
      these Hamlet-weaknesses are accompanied by a habit of philosophic thought,
      and are enlivened by a nimble wit and great lyrical power. In Arthur
      Shakespeare is bent on revealing his qualities of heart, and in &ldquo;Richard
      II.&rdquo; his qualities of mind, and that these two are but parts of the same
      nature is proved by the fact that Arthur shows great quickness of
      apprehension and felicity of speech, while Richard once or twice at least
      displays a tenderness of heart and longing for love worthy of Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears then that Shakespeare's nature even in hot, reckless youth was
      most feminine and affectionate, and that even when dealing with histories
      and men of action he preferred to picture irresolution and weakness rather
      than strength, and felt more sympathy with failure than with success.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. SHAKESPEARE'S MEN OF ACTION (<i>continued</i>). HOT-SPUR, HENRY
      V., RICHARD III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The conclusions we have already reached, will be borne out and
      strengthened in unexpected ways by the study of Hotspur&mdash;Shakespeare's
      master picture of the man of action. The setting sun of chivalry falling
      on certain figures threw gigantic shadows across Shakespeare's path, and
      of these figures no one deserved immortality better than Harry Percy.
      Though he is not introduced in &ldquo;The Famous Victories of Henry V.,&rdquo; the old
      play which gave Shakespeare his roistering Prince and the first faint hint
      of Falstaff, Harry Percy lived in story and in oral tradition. His
      nickname itself is sufficient evidence of the impression he had made on
      the popular fancy. And both Prince Henry when mocking him, and his wife
      when praising him, bear witness to what were, no doubt, the accepted
      peculiarities of his character. Hotspur lived in the memory of men, we may
      be sure, with thick, hasty speech, and hot, impatient temper, and it is
      easy, I think, even at this late date, to distinguish Shakespeare's
      touches on the traditional portrait. It is for the reader to say whether
      Shakespeare blurred the picture, or bettered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotspur's first words to the King in the first act are admirable; they
      bring the brusque, passionate soldier vividly before us; but I am sure
      Shakespeare had the fact from history or tradition.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
  But, I remember, when the fight was done,
  When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
  Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
  Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dressed,
  Fresh as a bridegroom.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hotspur's picture of this &ldquo;popinjay&rdquo; with pouncet-box in hand, and
      &ldquo;perfumed like a milliner,&rdquo; is splendid self-revelation:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;he made me mad,
  To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet,
  And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But immediately afterwards Hotspur's defence of Mortimer shows the poet
      Shakespeare rather than the rude soldier who hates nothing more than
      &ldquo;mincing poetry.&rdquo; The beginning is fairly good:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Hot</i>.       Revolted Mortimer!
  He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
  But by the chance of war: to prove that true,
  Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
  Those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took,
  When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This &ldquo;gentle Severn's sedgy bank&rdquo; is too poetical for Hotspur; but what
      shall be said of his description of the river?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
  Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
  And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
  Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was still too young, too much in love with poetry to confine
      himself within the nature of Hotspur. But the character of Hotspur was so
      well known that Shakespeare could not long remain outside it. When the
      King cuts short the audience with the command to send back the prisoners,
      we find the passionate Hotspur again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And if the devil come and roar for them,
  I will not send them.&mdash;I will after straight,
  And tell him so: for I will ease my heart,
  Although it be with hazard of my head.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The last line strikes a false note; such a reflection throws cold water on
      the heat of passion, and that is not intended, for though reproved by his
      father Hotspur storms on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Speak of Mortimer!
  'Zounds! I will speak of him; and let my soul
  Want mercy, if I do not join with him....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The next long speech of Hotspur is mere poetic slush; he begins:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Nay, then, I cannot blame his cousin king,
  That wish'd him on the barren mountains starve....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and goes on for thirty lines to reprove the conspirators for having put
      down &ldquo;Richard, that sweet lovely rose,&rdquo; and planted &ldquo;this thorn,
      Bolingbroke.&rdquo; This long speech retards the action, obscures the character
      of Hotspur, and only shows Shakespeare poetising without a flash of
      inspiration. Then comes Hotspur's famous speech about honour:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
  To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon;
  Or dive into the bottom of the deep ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And immediately afterwards a speech in which his uncontrollable impatience
      and the childishness which always lurks in anger, find perfect expression.
      To soothe him, Worcester says he shall keep his prisoners; Hotspur bursts
      out:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Nay, I will: that's flat.
  He said, he would not ransom Mortimer;
  Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
  But I will find him when he lies asleep,
  And in his ear I'll holla&mdash;'Mortimer!' Nay,
  I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
  Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him,
  To keep his anger still in motion.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      No wonder Lord Worcester reproves him, and his father chides him as &ldquo;a
      wasp-stung and impatient fool,&rdquo; who will only talk and not listen. But
      again Hotspur breaks forth, and again his anger paints him to the life:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Why, look you, I am whipped and scourged with rods,
  Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
  Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
  In Richard's time,&mdash;what do you call the place?&mdash;
  A plague upon 't&mdash;it is in Glostershire;&mdash;
  'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,&mdash;...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The very ecstasy of impatience and of puerile passionate temper has never
      been better rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      His soliloquy, too, in the beginning of scene iii, when he reads the
      letter which throws the cold light of reason on his enterprise, is
      excellent, though it repeats qualities we already knew in Hotspur, and
      does not reveal new ones:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  '&ldquo;The purpose you undertake is dangerous';&mdash;why,
  that's certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to
  drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle
  danger, we pluck this flower safety.... What a frosty-spirited
  rogue is this!... O, I could divide myself and
  go to buffets, for moving such a dish of skimmed milk
  with so honourable an action! Hang him! Let him tell
  the King: we are prepared. I will set forward to-night.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But the topmost height of self-revealing is reached in the scene with his
      wife which immediately follows this. Lady Percy enters, and Hotspur greets
      her:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;How now, Kate? I must leave you within these two hours.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The lady's reply is too long and too poetical. Hotspur interrupts her by
      calling the servant and giving him orders. Then Lady Percy questions, and
      Hotspur avoids a direct answer, and little by little Shakespeare works
      himself into the characters till even Lady Percy lives for us:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Lady</i>. Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
  Directly unto this question that I ask.
  In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,
  An if thou wilt not tell me true.
  <i>Hot</i>.                       Away,
  Away, you trifler!&mdash;Love?&mdash;I love thee not,
  I care not for thee, Kate; this is no world
  To play with mammets and to tilt with lips....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It shows a certain immaturity of art that Hotspur should introduce the
      theme of &ldquo;love,&rdquo; and not Lady Percy; but, of course, Lady Percy seizes on
      the word:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Lady</i>. Do you not love me? do you not, indeed,
  Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
  I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
  Nay, tell me, if you speak in jest or no?
  <i>Hot</i>. Come, wilt thou see me ride?
  And when I am o' horseback, I will swear
  I love thee infinitely....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All this is superb; Hotspur's coarse contempt of love deepens our sense of
      his soldier-like nature and eagerness for action; but though the qualities
      are rendered magically the qualities themselves are few: Shakespeare still
      harps upon Hotspur's impatience; but even a soldier is something more than
      hasty temper, and disdain of love's dalliance. But the portrait is not
      finished yet. The first scene in the third act between Hotspur and
      Glendower is on this same highest level; Hotspur's impatience of
      Glendower's bragging at length finds an unforgetable phrase:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Glend</i>. I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
  <i>Hot</i>. Why, so can I, or so can any man;
  But will they come when you do call for them?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then Hotspur disputes over the division of England; he wants a larger
      share than that allotted to him; the trait is typical, excellent; but the
      next moment Shakespeare effaces it. As soon as Glendower yields, Hotspur
      cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I do not care; I'll give thrice so much land
  Away to any well-deserving friend;
  But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
  I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This large generosity is a trait of Shakespeare and not of Hotspur; the
      poet cannot bear to lend his hero a tinge of meanness, or of avarice, and
      yet the character needs a heavy shadow or two, and no shadow could be more
      appropriate than this, for greed of land has always been a characteristic
      of the soldier-aristocrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare is perfectly willing to depict Hotspur as scorning the arts.
      When Glendower praises poetry, Hotspur vows he'd &ldquo;rather be a kitten and
      cry mew ... than a metre ballad-monger. ...&rdquo; Nothing sets his teeth on
      edge &ldquo;so much as mincing poetry&rdquo;: and a little later he prefers the
      howling of a dog to music. When he is reproved by Lord Worcester for
      &ldquo;defect of manners, want of government, ... pride, haughtiness, disdain,&rdquo;
       his reply is most characteristic:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Well, I am schooled: good manners be your speed,
  Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He is too old to learn, and his self-assurance is not to be shaken; but
      though he hates schooling he will school his wife:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
  A good mouth-filling oath; and leave, 'in sooth,'
  And such protest of pepper-gingerbread
  To velvet guards and Sunday citizens.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is merely a repetition of the trait shown in his first speech when he
      sneered at the popinjay-lord for talking in &ldquo;holiday and lady terms.&rdquo; But
      not only does Shakespeare repeat well-known traits in Hotspur, he also
      uses him as a mere mouthpiece again and again, as he used him at the
      beginning in the poetic description of the Severn. The fourth act opens
      with a speech of Hotspur to Douglas, which is curiously illustrative of
      this fault:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Hot.</i>. Well said, my noble Scot, if speaking truth
  In this fine age were not thought flattery,
  Such attribution should the Douglas have,
  As not a soldier of this season's stamp
  Should go so general current through the world.
  By God, I cannot flatter; I defy
  The tongues of soothers; but a braver place
  In my heart's love hath no man than yourself.
  Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the first five lines of this skimble-skamble stuff I hear Shakespeare
      speaking in his cheapest way; with the oath, however, he tries to get into
      the character again, and succeeds indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately afterwards Hotspur is shocked by the news that his father is
      sick and has not even sent the promised assistance; struck to the heart by
      the betrayal, the hot soldier should now reveal his true character; one
      expects him to curse his father, and rising to the danger, to cry that he
      is stronger without traitors and faint-heart friends. But Shakespeare the
      philosopher is chiefly concerned with the effect of such news upon a rebel
      camp, and again he speaks through Hotspur:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
  The very life-blood of our enterprise;
  'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then Shakespeare pulls himself up and tries to get into Hotspur's
      character again by representing to himself the circumstance:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;He writes me here, that inward sickness&mdash;
  And that his friends by deputation could not
  So soon be drawn; nor did he think it meet&mdash;&rdquo;
   and so forth to the question: &ldquo;...What say you to it?&rdquo;
   &ldquo;<i>Wor</i>. Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
  <i>Hot</i>. A perilous gash, a very limb lopped off:&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare sees that he cannot go on exaggerating the injury&mdash;that
      is not Hotspur's line, is indeed utterly false to Hotspur's nature; and so
      he tries to stop himself and think of Hotspur:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And yet, in faith, it's not; his present want
  Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
  To set the exact wealth of all our states
  All at one cast? to set so rich a main
  On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
  It were not good; for therein should we read
  The very bottom and the soul of hope,
  The very list, the very utmost bound
  Of all our fortunes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      After the first two lines, which Hotspur might have spoken, we have the
      sophistry of the thinker poetically expressed, and not one word from the
      hot, high-couraged soldier. Indeed, in the last four lines from the
      bookish &ldquo;we read&rdquo; to the end, we have the gentle poet in love with
      desperate extremities. The passage must be compared with Othello's&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
  And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But at length when Worcester adds fear to danger Hotspur half finds
      himself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Hot</i>,      You strain too far.
  I rather of his absence make this use:&mdash;
  It lends a lustre, and more great opinion,
  A larger dare to our great enterprise,
  Than if the earl were here; for men must think,
  If we, without his help can make a head
  To push against the kingdom; with his help
  We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.&mdash;
  Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And this is all. The scene is designed, the situation constructed to show
      us Hotspur's courage: here, if anywhere, the hot blood should surprise us
      and make of danger the springboard of leaping hardihood. But this is the
      best Shakespeare can reach&mdash;this fainting, palefaced &ldquo;Yet all goes
      well, yet all our joints are whole.&rdquo; The inadequacy, the feebleness of the
      whole thing is astounding. Milton had not the courage of the soldier, but
      he had more than this: he found better words for his Satan after defeat
      than Shakespeare found for Hotspur before the battle:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;What though the field be lost?
  All is not lost; the unconquerable will,
  And study of revenge, immortal hate,
  And courage never to submit or yield,
  And what is else not to be overcome;
  That glory never shall his wrath or might
  Extort from me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When Shakespeare has to render Hotspur's impatience he does it superbly,
      when he has to render Hotspur's courage he fails lamentably.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
In the third scene of this fourth act we have another striking instance
of Shakespeare's shortcoming. Sir Walter Blount meets the rebels &ldquo;with
gracious offers from the King,&rdquo; whereupon Hotspur abuses the King
through forty lines; this is the kind of stuff:
  &ldquo;My father and my uncle and myself
  Did give him that same royalty he wears;
  And when he was not six and twenty strong,
  Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
  A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
  My father gave him welcome to the shore; ...&rdquo;
 and so on and on, like Hamlet, he unpacks his heart with words, till
Blount cries:
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, I came not to hear this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hotspur admits the reproof, but immediately starts off again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Hot</i>. Then to the point.
  In short time after he deposed the king;
  Soon after that, deprived him of his life,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and so forth for twenty lines more, till Blount pulls him up again with
      the shrewd question:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Shall I return this answer to the king?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hotspur replies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Not so, Sir Walter; we'll withdraw awhile.
  Go to the king.....
  And in the morning early shall mine uncle
  Bring him our purposes; and so farewell.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And yet this Hotspur who talks interminably when he would do much better
      to keep quiet, assures us a little later that he has not well &ldquo;the gift of
      tongue,&rdquo; and again declares he's glad a messenger has cut him short, for
      &ldquo;I profess not talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth is the real Hotspur did not talk much, but Shakespeare had the
      gift of the gab, if ever a man had, and Hotspur was a mouthpiece. It is
      worth noting that though the dramatist usually works himself into a
      character gradually, Hotspur is best presented in the earlier scenes:
      Shakespeare began the work with the Hotspur of history and tradition clear
      in his mind; but as he wrote he grew interested in Hotspur and identified
      himself too much with his hero, and so almost spoiled the portrait. This
      is well seen in Hotspur's end; Prince Henry has said he'd crop his budding
      honours and make a garland for himself out of them, and this is how the
      dying Hotspur answers him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O Harry, thou hast robbed me of my youth!
  I better brook the loss of brittle life
  Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
  They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh:&mdash;
  But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool,
  And time, that takes survey of all the world,
  Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
  But that the earthy and cold hand of death
  Lies on my tongue:&mdash;no, Percy, thou art dust,
  And food for &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Of course, Prince Henry concludes the phrase, and continues the
      Hamlet-like philosophic soliloquy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>P. Henry</i>. For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well,
    great heart!&mdash;
  Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
  When that this body did contain a spirit,
  A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
  But now two paces of the vilest earth
  Is room enough: ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I have tried to do justice to this portrait of Hotspur, for Shakespeare
      never did a better picture of a man of action, indeed, as we shall soon
      see, he never did as well again. But take away from Hotspur the qualities
      given to him by history and tradition, the hasty temper, and thick
      stuttering speech, and contempt of women, and it will be seen how little
      Shakespeare added. He makes Hotspur hate &ldquo;mincing poetry,&rdquo; and then puts
      long poetic descriptions in his mouth; he paints the soldier despising
      &ldquo;the gift of tongue&rdquo; and forces him to talk historic and poetic slush in
      and out of season; he makes the aristocrat greedy and sets him quarrelling
      with his associates for more land, and the next moment, when the land is
      given him, Hotspur abandons it without further thought; he frames an
      occasion calculated to show off Hotspur's courage, and then allows him to
      talk faint-heartedly, and finally, when Hotspur should die mutely, or with
      a bitter curse, biting to the last, Shakespeare's Hotspur loses himself in
      mistimed philosophic reflection and poetic prediction. Yet such is
      Shakespeare's magic of expression that when he is revealing the qualities
      which Hotspur really did possess, he makes him live for us with such
      intensity of life that no number of false strokes can obliterate the
      impression. It is only the critic working <i>sine ira et studio</i> who
      will find this portrait blurred by the intrusion of the poet's
      personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the companion picture of Prince Henry that shows as in a glass
      Shakespeare's poverty of conception when he is dealing with the
      distinctively manly qualities. In order to judge the matter fairly we must
      remember that Shakespeare did not create Prince Henry any more than he
      created Hotspur. In the old play entitled &ldquo;The Famous Victories of Henry
      V.,&rdquo; and in the popular mouth, Shakespeare found roistering Prince Hal.
      The madcap Prince, like Harry Percy, was a creature of popular sympathy;
      his high spirits and extravagances, the vigorous way in which he had sown
      his wild oats, had taken the English fancy, the historic personage had
      been warmed to vivid life by the popular emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was personally interested in this princely hero. As we have
      seen, he dims Hotspur's portrait by intrusion of his own peculiarities;
      and in the case of Harry Percy, this temptation will be stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of the play, a young man of noble gifts led astray by loose
      companions, was a favourite subject with Shakespeare at this time; he had
      treated it already in &ldquo;Richard II.&rdquo;; and he handled it here again with
      such zest that we are almost forced to believe in the tradition that
      Shakespeare himself in early youth had sown wild oats in unworthy company.
      Helped by a superb model, and in full sympathy with his theme, Shakespeare
      might be expected to paint a magnificent picture. But Prince Henry is
      anything but a great portrait; he is at first hardly more than a prig, and
      later a feeble and colourless replica of Hotspur. It is very curious that
      even in the comedy scenes with Falstaff Shakespeare has never taken the
      trouble to realize the Prince: he often lends him his own word-wit, and
      now and then his own high intelligence, but he never for a moment
      discovers to us the soul of his hero. He does not even tell us what
      pleasure Henry finds in living and carousing with Falstaff. Did the Prince
      choose his companions out of vanity, seeking in the Eastcheap tavern a
      court where he might throne it? Or was it the infinite humour of Falstaff
      which attracted him? Or did he break bounds merely out of high spirits,
      when bored by the foolish formalities of the palace? Shakespeare, one
      would have thought, would have given us the key to the mystery in the very
      first scene. But this scene, which paints Falstaff to the soul, tells us
      nothing of the Prince; but rather blurs a figure which everyone imagines
      he knows at least in outline. Prince Henry's first speech is excellent as
      description; Falstaff asks him the time of day; he replies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and
  unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches
  after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly
  which thou wouldst truly know....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This helps to depict Falstaff, but does not show us the Prince, for
      good-humoured contempt of Falstaff is universal; it has nothing individual
      and peculiar in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes the speech in which the Prince talks of himself in Falstaff's
      strain as one of &ldquo;the moon's men&rdquo; who &ldquo;resolutely snatch a purse of gold
      on Monday night,&rdquo; and &ldquo;most dissolutely spend it on Tuesday morning.&rdquo; A
      little later he plays with Falstaff by asking: &ldquo;Where shall we take a
      purse to-morrow, Jack?&rdquo; It looks as if the Prince were ripe for worse than
      mischief. But when Falstaff wants to know if he will make one of the band
      to rob on Gadshill, he cries out, as if indignant and surprised:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  <i>P. Hen</i>. Who, I rob? la thief? Not I, by my faith.

  <i>Fal</i>. There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship
  in thee, nor thou earnest not of the blood royal,
  if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.

  <i>P. Hen</i>. Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.

  <i>Fal</i>. Why, that's well said.

  <i>P. Hen</i>. Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
</pre>
    <p>
      He is only persuaded at length by Poins's proposal to rob the robbers. It
      may be said that these changes of the Prince are natural in the situation:
      but they are too sudden and unmotived; they are like the nodding of the
      mandarin's head&mdash;they have no meaning; and surely, after the Prince
      talks of himself as one of &ldquo;the moon's men,&rdquo; it would be more natural of
      him, when the direct proposal to rob is made, not to show indignant
      surprise, which seems forced or feigned; but to talk as if repenting a
      previous folly. The scene, in so far as the Prince is concerned, is badly
      conducted. When he yields to Poins and agrees to rob Falstaff, his words
      are: &ldquo;Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us,&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase which
      hardly shows wild spirits or high courage, or even the faculty of judging
      men, and the soliloquy which ends the scene lamely enough is not the
      Prince's, but Shakespeare's, and unfortunately Shakespeare the poet, and
      not Shakespeare the dramatist:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>P. Hen</i>. I know you all and will awhile uphold
  The unyoked humour of your idleness.
  Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
  Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
  To smother up his beauty from the world,
  That, when he please again to be himself,
  Being wanted, he may be more wondered at,
  By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
  Of vapours, that did seem to strangle him. ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      If we could accept this stuff we should take Prince Henry for the prince
      of prigs; but it is impossible to accept it, and so we shrug our shoulders
      with the regret that the madcap Prince of history is not illuminated for
      us by Shakespeare's genius. In this &ldquo;First Part of Henry IV.,&rdquo; when the
      Prince is not calling names with Falstaff, or playing prig, he either
      shows us a quality of Harry Percy or of Shakespeare himself. Everyone
      remembers the scene when Falstaff, carrying Percy's corpse, meets the
      Princes, and tells them he has killed Percy:

  <i>P. John</i>. This is the strangest tale that e'er I heard.
  <i>P. Hen</i>. This is the strangest fellow, brother John.&mdash;
                  Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
                  For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
                  I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Both in manner and in matter these last two lines are pure Shakespeare,
      and Shakespeare speaks to us, too, when Prince Henry gives up Douglas to
      his pleasure &ldquo;ransomless and free.&rdquo; But not only does the poet lend the
      soldier his own sentiments and lilt of phrase, he also presents him to us
      as a shadowy replica of Hotspur, even during Hotspur's lifetime. We have
      already noticed Hotspur's admirable answer when Glendower brags that he
      can call spirits from the vasty deep:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Hot</i>. Why, so can I, or so can any man;
  But will they come, when you do call for them?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The same love of truth is given to Prince Henry in the previous act:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Fal</i>. Owen, Owen,&mdash;the same;&mdash;and his son-in-law,
  Mortimer; and old Northumberland; and that sprightly
  Scot of Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill
  perpendicular,&mdash;

  <i>P. Hen</i>. He that rides at high speed, and with his
  pistol kills a sparrow flying.

  <i>Fal</i>. You have hit it.

  <i>P. Hen</i>. So did he never the sparrow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But this frank contempt of lying is not the only or the chief
      characteristic possessed by Hotspur and Harry Percy in common. Hotspur
      disdains the Prince:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Hot</i>. Where is his son,
  The nimble-footed mad-cap Prince of Wales,
  And his comrádes that daffed the world aside
  And bid it pass?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and the Prince mimics and makes fun of Hotspur:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>P. Hen.</i> He that kills me some six or seven dozen
  of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands and says to his
  wife, 'Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then Hotspur brags of what he will do when he meets his rival:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Hot.</i>       Once ere night
  I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
  That he shall shrink under my courtesy.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And in precisely the same strain Prince Henry talks to his father:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>P. Hen.</i>      The time will come
  That I shall make this northern youth exchange
  His glorious deeds for my indignities.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is true that Prince Henry on more than one occasion praises Hotspur,
      while Hotspur is content to praise himself, but the differentiation is too
      slight to be significant: such as it is, it is well seen when the two
      heroes meet.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Hot.</i> My name is Harry Percy.
  <i>P. Hen.</i>               Why, then I see
  A very valiant rebel of that name.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      but Prince Henry immediately doffs this kingly mood to imitate Hotspur. He
      goes on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am the Prince of Wales, and think not, Percy,
  To share with me in glory any more;
  Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,
  Nor can our England brook a double reign
  Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And so the bombast rolls, and one brags against the other like systole and
      diastole which balance each other in the same heart. But the worst of the
      matter is, that Prince Henry and Hotspur, as we have already noticed, have
      both the same soul and the same inspiring motive in love of honour. They
      both avow this again and again, though Hotspur finds the finer expression
      for it when he cries that he will &ldquo;pluck bright honour from the pale-faced
      moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the student of the play it really looks as if Shakespeare could not
      imagine any other incentive to noble or heroic deeds but this love of
      glory: for nearly all the other serious characters in the play sing of
      honour in the same key. King Henry IV. envies Northumberland
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and declares that Percy hath got &ldquo;never-dying honour against renownéd
      Douglas.&rdquo; The Douglas, too, can find no other word with which to praise
      Hotspur&mdash;&ldquo;thou art the king of honour&rdquo;: even Vernon, a mere secondary
      character, has the same mainspring: he says to Douglas:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;If well-respected honour bid me on,
  I hold as little counsel with weak fear
  As you or any Scot that this day lives.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Falstaff himself declares that nothing &ldquo;pricks him on but honour,&rdquo; and
      bragging Pistol admits that &ldquo;honour is cudgelled&rdquo; from his weary limbs.
      The French, too, when they are beaten by Henry V. all bemoan their shame
      and loss of honour, and have no word of sorrow for their ruined homesteads
      and outraged women and children. The Dauphin cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Reproach and everlasting shame
  Sits mocking in our plumes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And Bourbon echoes him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is curious that Bourbon falls upon the same thought which animated
      Hotspur. Just before the decisive battle Hotspur cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, gentlemen! the time of life is short;
  To spend that shortness basely were too long.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And when the battle turns against the French, Bourbon exclaims:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The devil take order now! I'll to the throng:
  Let life be short; else shame will be too long.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As Jaques in &ldquo;As You Like It&rdquo; says of the soldier: they are &ldquo;jealous in
      honour&rdquo; and all seek &ldquo;the bubble reputation, even in the cannon's mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is only in Shakespeare that men have no other motive for brave deeds
      but love of honour, no other fear but that of shame with which to overcome
      the dread of death. We shall see later that the desire of fame was the
      inspiring motive of his own youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the &ldquo;Second Part of King Henry IV.&rdquo; there is very little told us of
      Prince Henry; he only appears in the second act, and in the fourth and
      fifth; and in all he is the mouthpiece of Shakespeare and not the
      roistering Prince: yet on his first appearance there are traces of
      characterization, as when he declares that his &ldquo;appetite is not princely,&rdquo;
       for he remembers &ldquo;the poor creature, small beer,&rdquo; whereas in the last act
      he is merely the poetic prig. Let us give the best scene first:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>P. Hen</i>. Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  <i>P. Hen</i>. Marry, I tell thee,&mdash;it is not meet that I should
  be sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell to thee&mdash;as
  to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my
  friend&mdash;I could be sad, and sad, indeed, too.

  <i>Poins</i>. Very hardly upon such a subject.
  <i>P. Hen.</i> By this hand, thou think'st me as far in the
  devil's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency:
  let the end try the man. But I tell thee, my
  heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick; and keeping
  such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken
  from me all ostentation of sorrow.

  <i>Poins</i>. The reason?

  <i>P. Hen</i>. What would'st thou think of me if I should
  weep?

  <i>Poins</i>. I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.

  <i>P. Hen</i>. It would be every man's thought; and thou
  art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks; never
  a man's thought in the world keeps the roadway better
  than thine: every man would think me an hypocrite indeed.
  And what accites your most worshipful thought to
  think so?

  <i>Poins</i>. Why, because you have been so lewd, and so
  much engraffed to Falstaff.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      By far the best thing in this page&mdash;the contempt for every man's
      thought as certain to be mistaken&mdash;is, I need hardly say, pure
      Shakespeare. Exactly the same reflection finds a place in &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;; the
      student-thinker tells us of a play which in his opinion, and in the
      opinion of the best judges, was excellent, but which was only acted once,
      for it &ldquo;pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general.&rdquo; Very early
      in life Shakespeare made the discovery, which all men of brains make
      sooner or later, that the thoughts of the million are worthless, and the
      judgment and taste of the million are execrable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing worthy to be called character-drawing in this scene; but
      there's just a hint of it in the last remark of Poins. According to his
      favourite companion the Prince was very &ldquo;lewd,&rdquo; and yet Shakespeare never
      shows us his lewdness in action; does not &ldquo;moralize&rdquo; it as Jaques or
      Hamlet would have been tempted to do. It is just mentioned and passed over
      lightly. It is curious, too, that Shakespeare's <i>alter ego</i>, Jaques,
      was also accused of lewdness by the exiled Duke; Vincentio, too, another
      incarnation of Shakespeare, was charged with lechery by Lucio; but in none
      of these cases does Shakespeare dwell on the failing. Shakespeare seems to
      have thought reticence the better part in regard to certain sins of the
      flesh. But it must be remarked that it is only when his heroes come into
      question that he practises this restraint: he is content to tell us
      casually that Prince Henry was a sensualist; but he shows us Falstaff and
      Doll Tearsheet engaged at lips' length. To put it briefly, Shakespeare
      attributes lewdness to his impersonations, but will not emphasize the
      fault by instances. Nor will Shakespeare allow his &ldquo;madcap Prince&rdquo; even to
      play &ldquo;drawer&rdquo; with hearty goodwill. While consenting to spy on Falstaff in
      the tavern, the Prince tells Poins that &ldquo;from a Prince to a prentice&rdquo; is
      &ldquo;a low transformation,&rdquo; and scarcely has the fun commenced when he is
      called to the wars and takes his leave in these terms:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>P. Hen.</i> By Heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,
  So idly to profane the precious time
  When tempest of commotion, like the south
  Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt
  And drop upon our bare, unarmed heads.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The first two lines are priggish, and the last three mere poetic
      balderdash. But it is in the fourth act, when Prince Henry is watching by
      the bedside of his dying father, that Shakespeare speaks through him
      without disguise:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow
  Being so troublesome a bedfellow?
  O polished perturbation! golden care!
  That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
  To many a watchful night!&mdash;Sleep with it now,
  Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
  As he whose brow with homely biggin bound
  Snores out the watch of night.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the third act we have King Henry talking in precisely the same way:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O sleep, O gentle sleep,
  Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee?...
       - -       - -       - -       - -
  Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
  Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
  In cradle of the rude imperious surge.&rdquo;...
</pre>
    <p>
      The truth is that in both these passages, as in a hundred similar ones, we
      find Shakespeare himself praising sleep as only those tormented by
      insomnia can praise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his father reproaches him with &ldquo;hunger for his empty chair,&rdquo; this is
      how Prince Henry answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O pardon me, my liege, but for my tears,
  The moist impediments unto my speech,
  I had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke.
  Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
  The course of it so far.&rdquo;...
</pre>
    <p>
      It might be Alfred Austin writing to Lord Salisbury&mdash;&ldquo;the moist
      impediments,&rdquo; forsooth&mdash;and the daredevil young soldier goes on like
      this for forty lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only memorable thing in the fifth act is the new king's contemptuous
      dismissal of Falstaff: I think it appalling at least in matter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;
  How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!
  I have long dreamed of such a kind of man,
  So surfeit-swelled, so old and so profane;
  But being awake I do despise my dream.
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  Reply not to me with a fool-born jest,
  Presume not that I am the thing I was;
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  Till then, I banish thee on pain of death,
  As I have done the rest of my misleaders,
  Not to come near our person by ten mile.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the old play, &ldquo;The Famous Victories,&rdquo; the sentence of banishment is
      pronounced; but this bitter contempt for the surfeit-swelled, profane old
      man is Shakespeare's. It is true that he mitigates the severity of the
      sentence in characteristic generous fashion: the King says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;For competence of life I will allow you
  That lack of means enforce you not to evil:
  And as we hear you do reform yourselves,
  We will, according to your strength and qualities,
  Give you advancement.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There is no mention in the old play of this &ldquo;competence of life.&rdquo; But in
      spite of this generous forethought the sentence is painfully severe, and
      Shakespeare meant every word of it, for immediately afterwards the Chief
      Justice orders Falstaff and his company to the Fleet prison; and in &ldquo;King
      Henry V.&rdquo; we are told that the King's condemnation broke Falstaff's heart
      and made the old jester's banishment eternal. To find Shakespeare more
      severe in judgement than the majority of spectators and readers is so
      astonishing, so singular a fact, that it cries for explanation. I think
      there can be no doubt that the tradition which tells us that Shakespeare
      in his youth played pranks in low company finds further corroboration
      here. He seems to have resented his own ignominy and the contemptuous
      estimate put upon him by others somewhat extravagantly.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Presume not that I am the thing I was;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;is a sentiment put again and again in Prince Henry's mouth; he is
      perpetually assuring us of the change in himself, and the great results
      which must ensue from it. It is this distaste for his own loose past and
      &ldquo;his misleaders,&rdquo; which makes Shakespeare so singularly severe towards
      Falstaff. As we have seen, he was the reverse of severe with Angelo in
      &ldquo;Measure for Measure,&rdquo; though in that case there was better ground for
      harshness. &ldquo;Measure for Measure,&rdquo; it is true, was written six or seven
      years later than &ldquo;Henry IV.,&rdquo; and the tragedy of Shakespeare's life
      separates the two plays. Shakespeare's ethical judgement was more inclined
      to severity in youth and early manhood than it was later when his own
      sufferings had deepened his sympathies, and he had been made &ldquo;pregnant to
      good pity,&rdquo; to use his own words, &ldquo;by the art of knowing and feeling
      sorrows.&rdquo; But he would never have treated old Jack Falstaff as harshly as
      he did had he not regretted the results, at least, of his own youthful
      errors. It looks as if Shakespeare, like other weak men, were filled with
      a desire to throw the blame on his &ldquo;misleaders.&rdquo; He certainly exulted in
      their punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult for me to write at length about the character of the King
      in &ldquo;Henry V.,&rdquo; and fortunately it is not necessary. I have already pointed
      out the faults in the painting of Prince Henry with such fullness that I
      may be absolved from again dwelling on similar weakness where it is even
      more obvious than it was in the two parts of &ldquo;Henry IV.&rdquo; But something I
      must say, for the critics in both Germany and England are agreed that
      &ldquo;'Henry V.' must certainly be regarded as Shakespeare's ideal of manhood
      in the sphere of practical achievement.&rdquo; Without an exception they have
      all buttered this drama with extravagant praise as one of Shakespeare's
      masterpieces, though in reality it is one of the worst pieces of work he
      ever did, almost as bad as &ldquo;Titus Andronicus&rdquo; or &ldquo;Timon&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Taming of
      the Shrew.&rdquo; Unfortunately for the would-be judges, Coleridge did not guide
      their opinions of &ldquo;Henry V.&rdquo;; he hardly mentioned the play, and so they
      all write the absurdest nonsense about it, praising because praise of
      Shakespeare has come to be the fashion, and also no doubt because his bad
      work is more on the level of their intelligence than his good work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can hardly be denied that Shakespeare identified himself as far as he
      could with Henry V. Before the King appears he is praised extravagantly,
      as Posthumus was praised, but the eulogy befits the poet better than the
      soldier. The Archbishop of Canterbury says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         ... &ldquo;When he speaks,
  The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
  And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears
  To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      the Bishop of Ely goes even further in excuse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  ...&ldquo;The prince obscured his contemplation
  Under the veil of wildness.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And this is how the soldier-king himself talks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
  And justly and religiously unfold
  Why the law Salique that they have in France
  Or should, or should not bar us in our claim;
  And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
  That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All this is plainly Shakespeare and Shakespeare at his very worst; and
      there are hundreds of lines like these, jewelled here and there by an
      unforgetable phrase, as when the Archbishop calls the bees: &ldquo;The singing
      masons building roofs of gold.&rdquo; The reply made by the King when the
      Dauphin sends him the tennis balls has been greatly praised for manliness
      and modesty; it begins:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
  His present and your pains we thank you for:
  When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,
  We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
  Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The first line is most excellent, but Shakespeare found it in the old
      play, and the bragging which follows is hardly bettered by the pious
      imprecation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor does the scene with the conspirators seem to me any better. The
      soldier-king would not have preached at them for sixty lines before
      condemning them. Nor would he have sentenced them with this extraordinary
      mixture of priggishness and pious pity:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>K. Hen</i>. God quit you in his mercy. Hear your
  sentence.
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  Touching our person seek we no revenge;
  But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
  Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
  We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
  Poor miserable wretches, to your death,
  The task whereof, God of His mercy give
  You patience to endure, and true repentance
  Of all your dear offences!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This &ldquo;poor miserable wretches&rdquo; would go better with a generous pardon, and
      such forgiving would be more in Shakespeare's nature. Throughout this play
      the necessity of speaking through the soldier-king embarrasses the poet,
      and the infusion of the poet's sympathy and emotion makes the puppet
      ridiculous. Henry's speech before Harfleur has been praised on all hands;
      not by the professors and critics merely, but by those who deserve
      attention. Carlyle finds deathless valour in the saying: &ldquo;Ye, good yeomen,
      whose limbs were made in England,&rdquo; and not deathless valour merely, but
      &ldquo;noble patriotism&rdquo; as well; &ldquo;a true English heart breathes, calm and
      strong through the whole business ... this man (Shakespeare) too had a
      right stroke in him, had it come to that.&rdquo; I find no valour in it,
      deathless or otherwise; but the make-believe of valour, the completest
      proof that valour was absent. Here are the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>K. Hen</i>. Once more unto the breach, dear friends,
  once more;
  Or close the wall up with our English dead.
  In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
  As modest stillness and humility:
  But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
  Then imitate the action of the tiger;
  Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
  Then lend the eye a terrible aspect,
  Let it pry through the portage of the head
  Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
  As fearfully as doth a galled rock
  O'erhang and jutty his confounded base....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And so on for another twenty lines. Now consider this stuff: first comes
      the reflection, more suitable to the philosopher than the man of action,
      &ldquo;in peace there's nothing so becomes a man...&rdquo;; then the soldier-king
      wishes his men to &ldquo;imitate&rdquo; the tiger's looks, to &ldquo;disguise fair nature,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;lend the eye a terrible aspect.&rdquo; But the man who feels the tiger's
      rage tries to control the aspect of it: he does not put on the frown&mdash;that's
      Pistol's way. The whole thing is mere poetic description of how an angry
      man looks and not of how a brave man feels, and that it should have
      deceived Carlyle, surprises me. The truth is that as soon as Shakespeare
      has to find, I will not say a magical expression for courage, but even an
      adequate and worthy expression, he fails absolutely. And is the patriotism
      in &ldquo;Ye, good yeomen, whose limbs were made in England&rdquo; a &ldquo;noble
      patriotism&rdquo;? or is it the simplest, the crudest, the least justifiable
      form of patriotism? There is a noble patriotism founded on the high and
      generous things done by men of one's own blood, just as there is the vain
      and empty self-glorification of &ldquo;limbs made in England,&rdquo; as if English
      limbs were better than those made in Timbuctoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third scene of the fourth act, just before the battle, Henry talks
      at his best, or rather Shakespeare's best: and we catch the true accent of
      courage. Westmoreland wishes
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        ...&ldquo;That we now had here
  But one ten thousand of those men in England
  That do no work to-day!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      but Henry lives on a higher plane:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                       &ldquo;No, my fair cousin:
  If we are marked to die, we are enow
  To do our country loss; and if to live,
  The fewer men the greater share of honour.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But this high-couraged sentiment is taken almost word for word from
      Holinshed. The rest of the speech shows us Shakespeare, as a splendid
      rhetorician, glorifying glory; now and then the rhetoric is sublimated
      into poetry:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers,
  For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
  Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
  This day shall gentle his condition.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's chief ambition about this time was to get a coat of arms for
      his father, and so gentle his condition. In all the play not one word of
      praise for the common archers, who won the battle; no mention save of the
      gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again in Henry V. the dissonance of character between the poet
      and his soldier-puppet jars upon the ears, and this dissonance is
      generally characteristic. For example, in the third act Shakespeare,
      through King Henry, expressly charges his soldiers that &ldquo;there be nothing
      compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the
      French upbraided or abused in disdainful language; for when lenity and
      cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.&rdquo;
       Wise words, not yet learned even by statesmen; drops of wisdom's
      life-blood from the heart of gentle Shakespeare. But an act later, when
      the battle is over, on the mere news that the French have reinforced their
      scattered men, Henry V., with tears in his eyes for the Duke of York's
      death, gives orders to kill the prisoners:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Then every soldier kill his prisoners;
  Give the word through.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The puppet is not even human: mere wood!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fifth act King Henry takes on the voice and nature of buried
      Hotspur. He woos Katherine exactly as Hotspur talked to his wife: he
      cannot &ldquo;mince&rdquo; it in love, he tells her, in Hotspur's very words; but is
      forthright plain; like Hotspur he despises verses and dancing; like
      Hotspur he can brag, too; finds it as &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to conquer kingdoms as to
      speak French; can &ldquo;vault into his saddle with his armour on his back&rdquo;; he
      is no carpet-soldier; he never &ldquo;looks in his glass for love of anything he
      sees there,&rdquo; and to make the likeness complete he disdains those &ldquo;fellows
      of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours ... a
      speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad.&rdquo; But if Shakespeare had
      had any vital sympathy for soldiers and men of action he would not have
      degraded Henry V. in this fashion, into a feeble replica of the
      traditional Hotspur. In those narrow London streets by the river he must
      have rubbed shoulders with great adventurers; he knew Essex; had bowed to
      Raleigh at the Court; must have heard of Drake: inclination was lacking,
      not models. He might even have differentiated between Prince Henry and
      Hotspur without going outside his history-books; but a most curious point
      is that he preferred to smooth away their differences and accentuate the
      likeness. As a mere matter of fact Hotspur was very much older than Prince
      Henry, for he fought at Otterbourne in 1388, the year of the prince's
      birth; but Shakespeare purposely and explicitly makes them both youths.
      The King, speaking of Percy to Prince Henry, says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And being no more in debt to years than thou.&rdquo;...
</pre>
    <p>
      It would have been wiser, I cannot but think, and more dramatic for
      Shakespeare to have left the hot-headed Percy as the older man who, in
      spite of years, is too impatient-quick to look before he leaps, while
      giving the youthful Prince the calm reflection and impersonal outlook
      which necessarily belong to a great winner of kingdoms. The dramatist
      could have further differentiated the rivals by making Percy greedy; he
      should not only have quarrelled with his associates over the division of
      the land, but insisted on obtaining the larger share, and even then have
      grumbled as if aggrieved; the soldier aristocrat has always regarded broad
      acres as his especial reward. On the other hand, Prince Henry should have
      been open-handed and carelessly-generous, as the patron of Falstaff was
      likely to be. Further, Hotspur might have been depicted as inordinately
      proud of his name and birth; the provincial aristocrat usually is, whereas
      Henry, the Prince, would surely have been too certain of his own qualities
      to need adventitious aids to pride. Percy might have been shown to us
      raging over imaginary slights; Worcester says he was &ldquo;governed by a
      spleen&rdquo;; while the Prince should have been given that high sense of honour
      and insatiate love of fame which were the poles of chivalry. Finally, the
      dramatist might have painted Hotspur, the soldier, as disdainful of women
      and the arts of music and poetry, while gracing Prince Henry with a wider
      culture and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I draw attention to such obvious points it is only to show how
      incredibly careless Shakespeare was in making the conqueror a poor copy of
      the conquered. He was drawn to Hotspur a little by his quickness and
      impatience; but he was utterly out of sympathy with the fighter, and never
      took the trouble even to think of the qualities which a leader of men must
      possess.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. SHAKESPEARE'S MEN OF ACTION (<i>concluded</i>): KING HENRY VI.
      AND RICHARD III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think it hardly necessary to extend this review of Shakespeare's
      historical plays by subjecting the Three Parts of &ldquo;King Henry VI.&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Richard III.&rdquo; to a detailed and minute criticism. Yet if I passed them
      over without mention it would probably be assumed that they made against
      my theory, or at least that I had some more pertinent reason for not
      considering them than their relative unimportance. In fact, however, they
      help to buttress my argument, and so at the risk of being tedious I shall
      deal with them, though as briefly as possible. Coleridge doubted whether
      Shakespeare had had anything to do with the &ldquo;First Part of Henry VI.,&rdquo; but
      his fellow-actors, Heminge and Condell, placed the Three Parts of &ldquo;King
      Henry VI.&rdquo; in the first collected edition of Shakespeare's plays, and our
      latest criticism finds good reasons to justify this contemporary
      judgement. Mr. Swinburne writes: &ldquo;The last battle of Talbot seems to me as
      undeniably the master's work as the scene in the Temple Gardens, or the
      courtship of Margaret by Suffolk&rdquo;; and it would be easy to prove that much
      of what the dying Mortimer says is just as certainly Shakespeare's work as
      any of the passages referred to by Mr. Swinburne. Like most of those who
      are destined to reach the heights, Shakespeare seems to have grown slowly,
      and even at twenty-eight or thirty years of age his grasp of character was
      so uncertain, his style so little formed, so apt to waver from blank verse
      to rhyme, that it is difficult to determine exactly what he did write. We
      may take it, I think, as certain that he wrote more than we who have his
      mature work in mind are inclined to ascribe to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Second Part of King Henry VI.&rdquo; is a poetic revision of the old play
      entitled &ldquo;The First Part of the Contention betwixt the Two Famous Houses
      of Yorke and Lancaster,&rdquo; and so forth. It is now generally agreed that
      Shakespeare's hand can be traced in the old drama, and with especial
      certainty in the comic scenes wherein Cade and his followers play the
      chief parts. Notwithstanding this, the revision was most thorough. Half
      the lines in the &ldquo;Second Part of Henry VI.&rdquo; are new, and by far the
      greater number of these are now ascribed to Shakespeare on good grounds.
      But some of the changes are for the worse, and as my argument does not
      stand in need of corroboration, I prefer to assume nothing, and shall
      therefore confine myself to pointing out that whoever revised &ldquo;The
      Contention&rdquo; did it, in the main, as we should have expected our youthful
      Shakespeare to do it. For example, when Humphrey of Gloster is accused of
      devising &ldquo;strange torments for offenders,&rdquo; he answers in the old play:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Why, 'tis well known that whilst I was Protector,
  Pitie was all the fault that was in me,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and the gentle reviser adds to this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;For I should melt at an offender's tears,
  And lowly words were ransom for their fault.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Besides, the reviser adds a great deal to the part of the weak King with
      the evident object of making his helplessness pathetic. He gives Henry,
      too, his sweetest phrases, and when he makes him talk of bewailing
      Gloster's case &ldquo;with sad unhelpful tears&rdquo; we catch the very cadence of
      Shakespeare's voice. But he does not confine his emendations to the
      speeches of one personage: the sorrows of the lovers interest him as their
      affection interested him in the &ldquo;First Part of Henry VI.,&rdquo; and the
      farewell words of Queen Margaret to Suffolk are especially characteristic
      of our gentle poet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Oh, go not yet; even thus two friends condemned
  Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
  Leather a hundred times to part than die.
  Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This reminds me almost irresistibly of Juliet's words when parting with
      Romeo, and of Imogen's words when Posthumus leaves her. Throughout the
      play Henry is the poet's favourite, and in the gentle King's lament for
      Gloster's death we find a peculiarity of Shakespeare's art. It was a part
      of the cunning of his exquisite sensibility to invent a new word whenever
      he was deeply moved, the intensity of feeling clothing itself aptly in a
      novel epithet or image. A hundred examples of this might be given, such as
      &ldquo;The multitudinous seas incarnadine&rdquo;; and so we find here &ldquo;paly lips.&rdquo; The
      passage is:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
  With twenty thousand kisses and to drain
  Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
  To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk
  And with my finger feel his hand unfeeling.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It must be noticed, too, that in this &ldquo;Second Part&rdquo; the reviser begins to
      show himself as something more than the sweet lyric poet. He transposes
      scenes in order to intensify the interest, and where enemies meet, like
      Clifford and York, instead of making them rant in mere blind hatred, he
      allows them to show a generous admiration of each other's qualities; in
      sum, we find here the germs of that dramatic talent which was so soon to
      bear such marvellous fruit. No better example of Shakespeare's growth in
      dramatic power and humour could be found than the way he revises the
      scenes with Cade. It is very probable, as I have said, that the first
      sketch was his; when one of Cade's followers declares that Cade's &ldquo;breath
      stinks,&rdquo; we are reminded that Coriolanus spoke in the same terms of the
      Roman rabble. But though it is his own work, Shakespeare evidently takes
      it up again with the keenest interest, for he adds inimitable touches. For
      instance, in the first scene, where the two rebels, George Bevis and John
      Holland, talk of Cade's rising and his intention to set a &ldquo;new nap upon
      the commonwealth,&rdquo; George's remark:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Oh, miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      an addition, and may be compared with Falstaff's:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;there is no virtue extant.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      John answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      which is in the first sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      But George's reply&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Nay, more; the King's Council are no good workmen&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      is only to be found in the revised version. The heightened humour of that
      &ldquo;Oh, miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen,&rdquo; assures us
      that the reviser was Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is true of the &ldquo;Second Part&rdquo; is true in the main of the &ldquo;Third Part
      of King Henry VI.&rdquo; Shakespeare's revisions are chiefly the revisions of a
      lyric poet, and he scatters his emendations about without much regard for
      character. In the Third Part, as in the Second, however, he transposes
      scenes, gives deeper life to the marionettes, and in various ways quickens
      the dramatic interest. This Third Part resembles &ldquo;King John&rdquo; in some
      respects and a similar inference can be drawn from it. As in &ldquo;King John&rdquo;
       we have the sharply contrasted figures of the Bastard and Arthur, so in
      this &ldquo;Third Part&rdquo; there are two contrasted characters, Richard Duke of
      Gloster and King Henry VI., the one a wild beast whose life is action, and
      who knows neither fear, love, pity, nor touch of any scruple; the other, a
      saint-like King whose worst fault is gentle weakness. In &ldquo;The True
      Tragedie of Richard,&rdquo; the old play on which this &ldquo;Third Part&rdquo; was founded,
      the character of Richard is powerfully sketched, even though the human
      outlines are sometimes confused by his devilish malignity. Shakespeare
      takes this character from the old play, and alters it but very slightly.
      Indeed, the most splendid piece of character-revealing in his Richard is
      to be found in the old play:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I had no father, I am like no father,
  I have no brother, I am like no brother;
  And this word <i>Love</i>b, which greybeards call divine,
  Be resident in men like one another,
  And not in me:&mdash;I am myself alone.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Satanic energy of this outburst proclaims its author, Marlowe.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Footnote: Mr. Swinburne was the first, I believe, to attribute this
      passage to Marlowe; he praises the verses, too, as they deserve; but as I
      had written the above before reading his work, I let it stand.}
      Shakespeare copies it word for word, only omitting with admirable art the
      first line. Indeed, though he alters the speeches of Richard and improves
      them, he does nothing more; he adds no new quality; his Richard is the
      Richard of &ldquo;The True Tragedie.&rdquo; But King Henry may be regarded as
      Shakespeare's creation. In the old play the outlines of Henry's character
      are so feebly, faintly sketched that he is scarcely recognizable, but with
      two or three touches Shakespeare makes the saint a living man. This King
      is happier in prison than in his palace; this is how he speaks to his
      keeper, the Lieutenant of the Tower:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Nay, be thou sure, I'll well requite thy kindness,
  For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
  Ay, such a pleasure as encagèd birds
  Conceive, when, after many moody thoughts,
  At last by notes of household harmony
  They quite forget their loss of liberty.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Just as the bird runs a little before he springs from the earth and takes
      flight, so Shakespeare often writes, as in this instance, an awkward weak
      line or two before his song-wings move with freedom. But the last four
      lines are peculiarly his; his the thought; his, too, the sweetness of the
      words &ldquo;encagèd birds&rdquo; and &ldquo;household harmony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Henry is not only shown to us as gentle and loving, but as a man
      who prefers quiet and the country to a King's Court and state. Even in
      eager, mounting youth this was Shakespeare's own choice: Prince Arthur in
      &ldquo;King John&rdquo; longs to be a shepherd: and this crowned saint has the same
      desire. From boyhood to old age Shakespeare preferred the &ldquo;life removed&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O God, methinks it were a happy life
  To be no better than a homely swain;
  To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
  To carve out dials quaintly point by point,
  Thereby to see the minutes how they run;
  How many make the hour full complete;
  How many hours bring about the day;
  How many days will finish up the year;
  How many years a mortal man may live.
     - -     - -     - -     - -     - -
  So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
  Passed over to the end they were created,
  Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All this it seems to me is as finely characteristic of the gentle
      melancholy of Shakespeare's youth as Jaques' bitter words are of the
      deeper melancholy of his manhood:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,
  And then from hour to hour we rot and rot
  And thereby hangs a tale.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Third Part of Henry VI.&rdquo; leads one directly to &ldquo;Richard III.&rdquo; It was
      Coleridge's opinion that Shakespeare &ldquo;wrote hardly anything of this play
      except the character of Richard. He found the piece a stock play and
      re-wrote the parts which developed the hero's character; he certainly did
      not write the scenes in which Lady Anne yielded to the usurper's
      solicitations.&rdquo; In this instance Coleridge's positive opinion deserves to
      be weighed respectfully. At the time when &ldquo;Richard III.&rdquo; was written
      Shakespeare was still rather a lyric than a dramatic poet, and Coleridge
      was a good judge of the peculiarities of his lyric style. Of course,
      Professor Dowden, too, is in doubt whether &ldquo;Richard III.&rdquo; should be
      ascribed to Shakespeare. He says: &ldquo;Its manner of conceiving and presenting
      character has a certain resemblance, not elsewhere to be found in
      Shakespeare's writings, to the ideal manner of Marlowe. As in the plays of
      Marlowe, there is here one dominant figure distinguished by a few strongly
      marked and inordinately developed qualities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This faulty reasoning only shows how dangerous it is for a professor to
      copy his teacher slavishly: in &ldquo;Coriolanus,&rdquo; too, we have the &ldquo;one
      dominant figure,&rdquo; and all the rest of it. The truth seems to be that in
      the &ldquo;Third Part of Henry VI.&rdquo; Shakespeare had been working with Marlowe,
      or, at least, revising Marlowe's work; in either case he was so steeped in
      Marlowe's spirit that he took, as we have seen, the most splendid piece of
      Richard's self-revealing directly from the older poet. Moreover, the words
      of deepest characterization in Shakespeare's &ldquo;Richard III.,&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Richard loves Richard&mdash;that is, I am I,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      are manifestly a weak echo of the tremendous
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am myself alone&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      of Marlowe's Richard. At least to this extent, then, Shakespeare used
      Marlowe in depicting Richard's character. But this trait, important as it
      was did not carry him far, and he was soon forced to draw on his own
      experience of life. Already he seems to have noticed that one
      characteristic of men of action is a blunt plainness of speech; their
      courage is shown in their frankness, and, besides, words stand for
      realities with them, and are, therefore, used with sincerity.
      Shakespeare's Richard III. uses plain speech as a hypocritical mask, but
      already Shakespeare is a dramatist and in his clever hands Richard's plain
      speaking is so allied with his incisive intelligence that it appears to be
      now a mask, now native shamelessness, and thus the characterization wins
      in depth and mystery. Every now and then, too, this Richard sees things
      which no Englishman has been capable of seeing, except Shakespeare
      himself. The whole of Plato's &ldquo;Gorgias&rdquo; is comprised in the two lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The declaration of the second murderer that conscience &ldquo;makes a man a
      coward ... it beggars any man that keeps it; it is turned out of all towns
      and cities for a dangerous thing; and every man that means to live well
      endeavours to trust to himself and to live without it,&rdquo; should be regarded
      as the complement of what Falstaff says of honour; in both the humour of
      Shakespeare's characteristic irony is not to be mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole play, I think, must be ascribed to Shakespeare; all the
      memorable words in it are indubitably his, and I cannot believe that any
      other hand drew for us that marvellous, masterful courtship of Anne which
      Coleridge, naturally enough, was unwilling to appreciate. The structure of
      the play, however, shows all the weakness of Marlowe's method: the
      interest is concentrated on the protagonist; there is not humour enough to
      relieve the gloomy intensity, and the scenes in which Richard does not
      figure are unattractive and feeble.
    </p>
    <p>
      One has only to think of the two characters&mdash;Richard II. and Richard
      III.&mdash;and to recall their handling in order to get a deep impression
      of Shakespeare's nature. He cannot present the vile Richard II. at all; he
      has no interest in him; but as soon as he thinks of Richard's youth and
      remembers that he was led astray by others, he begins to identify himself
      with him, and at once Richard's weakness is made amiable and his
      sufferings affecting. In measure as Shakespeare lets himself go and paints
      himself more and more freely, his portraiture becomes astonishing, till at
      length the imprisoned Richard gives himself up to melancholy philosophic
      musing, without a tinge of bitterness or envy or hate, and every one with
      eyes to see, is forced to recognize in him a younger brother to Hamlet and
      Posthumus. &ldquo;Richard III.&rdquo; was produced in a very different way. It was
      Marlowe's daemonic power and intensity that first interested Shakespeare
      in this Richard; under the spell of Marlowe's personality Shakespeare
      conceived the play, and especially the scene between Richard and Anne; but
      the original impulse exhausted itself quickly, and then Shakespeare fell
      back on his own experience and made Richard keen of insight and
      hypocritically blunt of speech&mdash;a sort of sketch of Iago. A little
      later Shakespeare either felt that the action was unsuitable to the
      development of such a character, or more probably he grew weary of the
      effort to depict a fiend; in any case, the play becomes less and less
      interesting, and even the character of Richard begins to waver. There is
      one astonishing instance of this towards the end of the drama. On the eve
      of the decisive battle Richard starts awake from his terrifying dreams,
      and now, if ever, one would expect from him perfect sincerity of
      utterance. This is what we find:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;There is no creature loves me;
  And if I die no soul shall pity me;
  Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
  Find in myself no pity to myself?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The first two lines bespeak a loving, gentle nature, Shakespeare's nature,
      the nature of a Henry VI. or an Arthur, a nature which Richard III. would
      certainly have despised, and the last two lines are merely an objective
      ethical judgement wholly out of place and very clumsily expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sum up, then, for this is not the place to consider Shakespeare's share
      in &ldquo;Henry VIII.,&rdquo; I find that in the English historical plays the manly
      characters, Hotspur, Harry V., the great Bastard, and Richard III., are
      all taken from tradition or from old plays, and Shakespeare did nothing
      more than copy the traits which were given to him; on the other hand, the
      weak, irresolute, gentle, melancholy characters are his own, and he shows
      extraordinary resource in revealing the secret workings of their souls.
      Even in early manhood, and when handling histories and men of action,
      Shakespeare cannot conceal his want of sympathy for the practical leaders
      of men; he neither understands them deeply nor loves them; but in
      portraying the girlish Arthur and the Hamlet-like Richard II., and in
      drawing forth the pathos of their weakness, he is already without a rival
      or second in all literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am anxious not to deform the truth by exaggeration; a caricature of
      Shakespeare would offend me as a sacrilege, even though the caricature
      were characteristic, and when I find him even in youth one-sided, a poet
      and dreamer, I am minded to tell less than the truth rather than more. He
      was extraordinarily sensitive, I say to myself, and lived in the stress of
      great deeds; he treated Henry V., a man of action if ever there was one,
      as an ideal, and lavished on him all his admiration, but it will not do: I
      cannot shut my eyes to the fact; the effort is worse than useless. He
      liked Henry V. because of his misled youth and his subsequent rise to
      highest honour, and not because of his practical genius. Where in his
      portrait gallery is the picture of a Drake, or even of a Raleigh? The
      adventurer was the characteristic product of that jostling time; but
      Shakespeare turned his head away; he was not interested in him. In spite
      of himself, however, he became passionately interested in the pitiful
      Richard II. and his untimely fate. Notwithstanding the praise of the
      critics, his King Henry V. is a wooden marionette; the intense life of the
      traditional madcap Prince has died out of him; but Prince Arthur lives
      deathlessly, and we still hear his childish treble telling Hubert of his
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who disagree with me will have to account for the fact that, even in
      the historical plays written in early manhood, all his portraits of men of
      action are mere copies, while his genius shines in the portraits of a
      gentle saint like Henry VI., of a weakling like Richard II., or of a
      girlish youth like Arthur&mdash;all these favourite studies being alike in
      pathetic helplessness and tender affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious that no one of the commentators has noticed this
      extraordinary one-sidedness of Shakespeare. In spite of his miraculous
      faculty of expression, he never found wonderful phrases for the virile
      virtues or virile vices. For courage, revenge, self-assertion, and
      ambition we have finer words in English than any that Shakespeare coined.
      In this field Chapman, Milton, Byron, Carlyle, and even Bunyan are his
      masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, as a man he had the instinct of courage, and an admiration of
      courage; his intellect, too, gave him some understanding of its range. Dr.
      Brandes declares that Shakespeare has only depicted physical courage, the
      courage of the swordsman; but that is beside the truth: Dr. Brandes has
      evidently forgotten the passage in &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo; when Caesar
      contemptuously refuses the duel with Antony and speaks of his antagonist
      as an &ldquo;old ruffian.&rdquo; Enobarbus, too, sneers at Antony's proposed duel:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will
  Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show
  Against a sworder.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Unhelped by memory, Dr. Brandes might have guessed that Shakespeare would
      exhaust the obvious at first glance. But the soul of courage to
      Shakespeare is, as we have seen, a love of honour working on quick
      generous blood&mdash;a feminine rather than a masculine view of the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlyle has a deeper sense of this aboriginal virtue. With the fanatic's
      trust in God his Luther will go to Worms &ldquo;though it rain devils&rdquo;; and when
      in his own person Carlyle spoke of the small, honest minority desperately
      resolved to maintain their ideas though opposed by a huge hostile majority
      of fools and the insincere, he found one of the finest expressions for
      courage in all our literature. The vast host shall be to us, he cried, as
      &ldquo;stubble is to fire.&rdquo; It may be objected that this is the voice of
      religious faith rather than of courage pure and simple, and the objection
      is valid so far as it goes; but this genesis of courage is peculiarly
      English, and the courage so formed is of the highest. Every one remembers
      how Valiant-for-Truth fights in Bunyan's allegory: &ldquo;I fought till my sword
      did cleave to my hand; and when they were joined together, as if a sword
      grew out of my arm, and when the blood ran through my fingers, then I
      fought with most courage.&rdquo; The mere expression gives us an understanding
      of the desperate resolution of Cromwell's Ironsides.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if desperate courage is not in Shakespeare, neither are its ancillary
      qualities&mdash;cruelty, hatred, ambition, revenge. Whenever he talks on
      these themes, he talks from the teeth outwards, as one without experience
      of their violent delights. His Gloucester rants about ambition without an
      illuminating or even a convincing word. Hatred and revenge Shakespeare
      only studied superficially, and cruelty he shudders from like a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is astounding how ill-endowed Shakespeare was on the side of manliness.
      His intellect was so fine, his power of expression so magical, the men
      about him, his models, so brave&mdash;founders as they were of the British
      empire and sea-tyranny&mdash;that he is able to use his Hotspurs and
      Harrys to hide from the general the poverty of his temperament. But the
      truth will out: Shakespeare was the greatest of poets, a miraculous
      artist, too, when he liked; but he was not a hero, and manliness was not
      his <i>forte</i>: he was by nature a neuropath and a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a master of passion and pity, and it astonishes one to notice how
      willingly he passed always to that extreme of sympathy where nothing but
      his exquisite choice of words and images saved him from falling into the
      silly. For example, in &ldquo;Titus Andronicus,&rdquo; with its crude, unmotived
      horrors, Titus calls Marcus a murderer, and when Marcus replies: &ldquo;Alas, my
      lord, I have but killed a fly,&rdquo; Titus answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;But how, if that fly had a father and mother?
  How would he hang his slender gilded wings,
  And buzz lamenting doings in the air?
  Poor harmless fly!
  That with his pretty buzzing melody,
  Came here to make us merry! and thou hast killed him.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Even in his earliest plays in the noontide of lusty youth, when the heat
      of the blood makes most men cruel, or at least heedless of others'
      sorrows, Shakespeare was full of sympathy; his gentle soul wept with the
      stricken deer and suffered through the killing of a fly. Just as Ophelia
      turned &ldquo;thought and affliction, passion, hell itself&rdquo; to &ldquo;favour and to
      prettiness,&rdquo; so Shakespeare's genius turned the afflictions and passions
      of man to pathos and to pity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. SHAKESPEARE AS LYRIC POET: &ldquo;TWELFTH NIGHT&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Shakespeare began the work of life as a lyric poet. It was to be expected
      therefore that when he took up playwriting he would use the play from time
      to time as an opportunity for a lyric, and in fact this was his constant
      habit. From the beginning to the end of his career he was as much a lyric
      poet as a dramatist. His first comedies are feeble and thin in
      character-drawing and the lyrical sweetness is everywhere predominant. His
      apprenticeship period may be said to have closed with his first tragedy,
      &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rdquo; I am usually content to follow Mr. Furnival's &ldquo;Trial
      Table of the order of Shakspere's Plays,&rdquo; in which &ldquo;Richard II.,&rdquo; &ldquo;Richard
      III.,&rdquo; and &ldquo;King John&rdquo; are all placed later than &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo; and
      yet included in the first period that stretches from 1585 to 1595. But
      &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; seems to me to be far more characteristic of the poet's
      genius than any of these histories; it is not only a finer work of art
      than any of them, and therefore of higher promise, but in its lyrical
      sweetness far more truly representative of Shakespeare's youth than any of
      the early comedies or historical plays. Whatever their form may be, nearly
      all Shakespeare's early works are love-songs, &ldquo;Venus and Adonis,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Lucrece,&rdquo; &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona,&rdquo; and he
      may be said to have ended his apprenticeship with the imperishable tragedy
      of first love &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the years from 1585 to 1595 Shakespeare brought the lyric element into
      something like due subordination and managed to free himself almost
      completely from his early habit of rhyming. Mr. Swinburne has written of
      Shakespeare's use of rhymed verse with a fullness of knowledge and
      sympathy that leaves little to be desired. He compares it aptly to the use
      of the left hand instead of the right, and doubts cogently whether
      Shakespeare ever attained such mastery of rhyme as Marlowe in &ldquo;Hero and
      Leander.&rdquo; But I like to think that Shakespeare's singing quickly became
      too sincere in its emotion and too complex in its harmonies to tolerate
      the definite limits set by rhyme. In any case by 1595 Shakespeare had
      learned to prefer blank verse to rhyme, at least for play-writing; he thus
      made the first great step towards a superb knowledge of his instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period of Shakespeare's maturity defines itself sharply; it stretches
      from 1595 to 1608 and falls naturally into two parts; the first part
      includes the trilogy &ldquo;Henry IV.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Henry V.&rdquo; and his golden comedies;
      the second, from 1600 to 1608, is entirely filled with his great
      tragedies. The characteristic of this period so far as regards the
      instrument is that Shakespeare has come to understand the proper function
      of prose. He sees first that it is the only language suited to broad
      comedy, and goes on to use it in moments of sudden excitement, or when
      dramatic truth to character seems to him all important. At his best he
      uses blank verse when some emotion sings itself to him, and prose as the
      ordinary language of life, the language of surprise, laughter, strife, and
      of all the commoner feelings. During these twelve or fourteen years the
      lyric note is not obtrusive; it is usually subordinated to character and
      suited to action.
    </p>
    <p>
      His third and last period begins with &ldquo;Pericles&rdquo; and ends with the
      &ldquo;Tempest&rdquo;; it is characterized, as we shall see later, by bodily weakness
      and by a certain contempt for the dramatic fiction. But the knowledge of
      the instrument once acquired never left Shakespeare. It is true that the
      lyric note becomes increasingly clear in his late comedies; but prose too
      is used by him with the same mastery that he showed in his maturity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first period Shakespeare was often unable to give his puppets
      individual life; in maturity he was interested in the puppets themselves
      and used them with considerable artistry; in the third period he had grown
      a little weary of them and in &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo; showed himself inclined, just
      as Goethe in later life was inclined, to turn his characters into symbols
      or types.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place of &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; is as clearly marked in Shakespeare's works
      as &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Tempest.&rdquo; It stands on the dividing line
      between his light, joyous comedies and the great tragedies; it was all
      done at the topmost height of happy hours, but there are hints in it which
      we shall have to notice later, which show that when writing it Shakespeare
      had already looked into the valley of disillusion which he was about to
      tread. But &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; is written in the spirit of &ldquo;As You Like It&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;Much Ado,&rdquo; only it is still more personal-ingenuous and less dramatic
      than these; it is, indeed, a lyric of love and the joy of living.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no intenser delight to a lover of letters than to find
      Shakespeare singing, with happy unconcern, of the things he loved best&mdash;not
      the Shakespeare of Hamlet or Macbeth, whose intellect speaks in critical
      judgements of men and of life, and whose heart we are fain to divine from
      slight indications; nor Shakespeare the dramatist, who tried now and again
      to give life to puppets like Coriolanus and Iago, with whom he had little
      sympathy; but Shakespeare the poet, Shakespeare the lover, Shakespeare
      whom Ben Jonson called &ldquo;the gentle,&rdquo; Shakespeare the sweet-hearted singer,
      as he lived and suffered and enjoyed. If I were asked to complete the
      portrait given to us by Shakespeare of himself in Hamlet-Macbeth with one
      single passage, I should certainly choose the first words of the Duke in
      &ldquo;Twelfth Night.&rdquo; I must transcribe the poem, though it will be in every
      reader's remembrance; for it contains the completest, the most
      characteristic, confession of Shakespeare's feelings ever given in a few
      lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;If music be the food of love, play on;
  Give me excess of it, that surfeiting
  The appetite may sicken, and so die.
  That strain again;&mdash;it had a dying fall:
  Oh, it came o'er my ear like the sweet south
  That breathes upon a bank of violets,
  Stealing and giving odour.&mdash;Enough! no more
  'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Every one will notice that Shakespeare as we know him in Romeo is here
      depicted again with insistence on a few salient traits; here, too, we have
      the poet of the Sonnets masquerading as a Duke and the protagonist of yet
      another play. There is still less art used in characterizing this Duke
      than there is in characterizing Macbeth; Shakespeare merely lets himself
      go and sings his feelings in the most beautiful words. This is his
      philosophy of music and of love:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Give me excess of it, that surfeiting,
  The appetite may sicken, and so die&rdquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      and then:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Enough, no more; 'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;the quick revulsion of the delicate artist-voluptuary who wishes to
      keep unblunted in memory the most exquisite pang of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speech after speech discovers the same happy freedom and absolute
      abandonment to the &ldquo;sense of beauty.&rdquo; Curio proposes hunting the hart, and
      at once the Duke breaks out:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.
  O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
  Methought she purged the air of pestilence.
  That instant was I turned into a hart,
  And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
  E'er since pursue me.&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Valentine then comes to tell him that Olivia is still mourning for her
      brother, and the Duke seizes the opportunity for another lyric:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
  To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
  How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
  Hath killed the flock of all affections else
  That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
  These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and filled&mdash;
  Her sweet perfections&mdash;with one self King!&mdash;
  Away before me to sweet beds of flowers,
  Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The last two lines show clearly enough that Shakespeare was not troubled
      with any thought of reality as he wrote: he was transported by Fancy into
      that enchanted country of romance where beds of flowers are couches and
      bowers, canopies of love. But what a sensuality there is in him!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 &ldquo;When liver, brain, and heart,
  These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and filled&mdash;
  Her sweet perfections&mdash;with one self King!&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Of course, too, this Duke is inconstant, and swings from persistent
      pursuit of Olivia to love of Viola without any other reason than the
      discovery of Viola's sex. In the same way Romeo turns from Rosaline to
      Juliet at first sight. This trait has been praised by Coleridge and others
      as showing singular knowledge of a young man's character, but I should
      rather say that inconstancy was a characteristic of sensuality and
      belonged to Shakespeare himself, for Orsino, like Romeo, has no reason to
      change his love; and the curious part of the matter is that Shakespeare
      does not seem to think that the quick change in Orsino requires any
      explanation at all. Moreover, the love of Duke Orsino for Olivia is merely
      the desire of her bodily beauty&mdash;the counterpart of the sensual
      jealousy of Othello. Speaking from Shakespeare's very heart, the Duke
      says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
  Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
  The parts that Fortune hath bestowed upon her,
  Tell her, I hold as giddily as Fortune;
  But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
  That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So the body wins the soul according to this Orsino, who is, I repeat
      again, Shakespeare in his most ingenuous and frankest mood; the contempt
      of wealth&mdash;&ldquo;dirty lands&rdquo;&mdash;and the sensuality&mdash;&ldquo;that miracle
      and queen of gems&rdquo;&mdash;are alike characteristic. A few more touches and
      the portrait of this Duke will be complete; he says to the pretended
      Cesario when sending him as ambassador to Olivia:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Cesario, Thou knowest no less but all; I have unclasped
  To thee the book even of my secret soul; Therefore, good youth,&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a matter of course that this Duke should tell everything to his
      friend; a matter of course, too, that he should love books and bookish
      metaphors. Without being told, one knows that he delights in all beautiful
      things&mdash;pictures with their faërie false presentment of forms and
      life; the flesh-firm outline of marble, the warmth of ivory and the
      sea-green patine of bronze&mdash;was not the poop of the vessel beaten
      gold, the sails purple, the oars silver, and the very water amorous?
    </p>
    <p>
      This Duke shows us Shakespeare's most intimate traits even when the action
      does not suggest the self-revelation. When sending Viola to woo Olivia for
      him he adds:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Some four or five, attend him;
  All if you will; for I myself am best
  When least in company.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Like Vincentio, that other mask of Shakespeare, this Duke too loves
      solitude and &ldquo;the life removed&rdquo;; he is &ldquo;best when least in company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If there is any one who still doubts the essential identity of Duke Orsino
      and Shakespeare, let him consider the likeness in thought and form between
      the Duke's lyric effusions and the Sonnets, and if that does not convince
      him I might use a hitherto untried argument. When a dramatist creates a
      man's character he is apt to make him, as the French say, too much of a
      piece&mdash;too logical. But, in this instance, though Shakespeare has
      given the Duke only a short part, he has made him contradict himself with
      the charming ease that belongs peculiarly to self-revealing. The Duke
      tells us:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;For such as I am all true lovers are,
  &mdash;Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
  Save in the constant image of the creature
  That is beloved.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The next moment he repeats this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
  Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
  More longing, wavering, sooner lost and won,
  Than women's are.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And the moment after he asserts:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;There is no woman's sides
  Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
  As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
  So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.
  Alas! their love may be called appetite,
  No motion of the liver, but the palate,
  That suffers surfeit, cloyment, and revolt!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hamlet contradicts himself, too: at one moment he declares that his soul
      is immortal, and at the next is full of despair. But Hamlet is so
      elaborate a portrait, built up of so many minute touches, that
      self-contradiction is a part, and a necessary part, of his many-sided
      complexity. But the Duke in &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; reveals himself as it were
      accidentally; we know little more of him than that he loves music and
      love, books and flowers, and that he despises wealth and company;
      accordingly, when he contradicts himself, we may suspect that Shakespeare
      is letting himself speak freely without much care for the coherence of
      characterization. And the result of this frankness is that he has given a
      more intimate, a more confidential, sketch of himself in Duke Orsino of
      &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; than he has given us in any play except perhaps &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Macbeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hardly need to prove that Shakespeare in his earliest plays, as in his
      latest, in his Sonnets as in his darkest tragedy, loved flowers and music.
      In almost every play he speaks of flowers with affection and delight. One
      only needs to recall the song in &ldquo;A Midsummer's Night's Dream,&rdquo; &ldquo;I know a
      bank,&rdquo; or Perdita's exquisite words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                 &ldquo;Daffodils,
  That come before the swallow dares, and take
  The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
  But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
  Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,
  That die unmarried ere they can behold
  Bright Phoebus in his strength, a malady
  Most incident to maids; bold oxlips, and
  The crown-imperial; lilies of all kinds,
  The flower-de-luce being one&rdquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      or Arviragus' praise of Imogen:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Thou shalt not lack
  The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor
  The azured harebell like thy veins; no, nor
  The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander
  Outsweetened not thy breath.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare praises music so frequently and so enthusiastically that we
      must regard the trait as characteristic of his deepest nature. Take this
      play which we are handling now. Not only the Duke, but both the heroines,
      Viola and Olivia, love music. Viola can sing &ldquo;in many sorts of music,&rdquo; and
      Olivia admits that she would rather hear Viola solicit love than &ldquo;music
      from the spheres.&rdquo; Romeo almost confounds music with love, as does Duke
      Orsino:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
  Like softest music to attending ears!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;And let rich music's tongue
  Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
  Receive in either by this dear encounter.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is a curious and characteristic fact that Shakespeare gives almost the
      same words to Ferdinand in the &ldquo;Tempest&rdquo; that he gave ten years earlier to
      the Duke in &ldquo;Twelfth Night.&rdquo; In both passages music goes with passion to
      allay its madness:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;This music crept by me upon the waters,
  Allaying both their fury and my passion
  With its sweet air&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and Duke Orsino says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;That old and antique song we heard last night,
  Methought it did relieve my passion much.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This confession is so peculiar; shows, too, so exquisitely fine a
      sensibility, that its repetition makes me regard it as Shakespeare's. The
      most splendid lyric on music is given to Lorenzo in the &ldquo;Merchant of
      Venice,&rdquo; and it may be remarked in passing that Lorenzo is not a
      character, but, like Claudio, a mere name and a mouthpiece of
      Shakespeare's feeling. Shakespeare was almost as well content, it appears,
      to play the lover as to play the Duke. I cannot help transcribing the
      magical verses, though they must be familiar to every lover of our English
      tongue:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
  Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music
  Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night
  Become the touches of sweet harmony.
  Sit, Jessica: Look how the floor of heaven
  Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold.
  There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
  But in his motion like an angel sings,
  Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims.
  Such harmony is in immortal souls;
  But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay
  Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The first lines of this poem are conceived in the very spirit of the poems
      of &ldquo;Twelfth Night,&rdquo; and in the last lines Shakespeare puts to use that
      divine imagination which lifts all his best verse into the higher air of
      life, and reaches its noblest in Prospero's solemn-sad lyric.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's love of music is so much a part of himself that he condemns
      those who do not share it; this argument, too, is given to Lorenzo:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The man that hath no music to himself,
  Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
  Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
  The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
  And his affections dark as Erebus:
  Let no such man be trusted.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      That this view was not merely the expression of a passing mood is shown by
      the fact that Shakespeare lends no music to his villains; but Timon gives
      welcome to his friends with music, just as Hamlet welcomes the players
      with music and Portia calls for music while her suitors make their
      eventful choice. Titania and Oberon both seek the aid of music to help
      them in their loves, and the war-worn and time-worn Henry IV. prays for
      music to bring some rest to his &ldquo;weary spirit&rdquo;; in much the same mood
      Prospero desires music when he breaks his wand and resigns his magical
      powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, again, in &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; in full manhood Shakespeare shows himself
      to us as Romeo, in love with flowers and music and passion. True, this
      Orsino is a little less occupied with verbal quips, a little more frankly
      sensual, too, than Romeo; but then Romeo would have been more frankly
      sensual had he lived from twenty-five to thirty-five. As an older man,
      too, Orsino has naturally more of Hamlet-Shakespeare's peculiar traits
      than Romeo showed; the contempt of wealth and love of solitude are
      qualities hardly indicated in Romeo, while in Orsino as in the mature
      Shakespeare they are salient characteristics. To sum up: Hamlet-Macbeth
      gives us Shakespeare's mind; but in Romeo-Orsino he has discovered his
      heart and poetic temperament to us as ingenuously, though not, perhaps, so
      completely, as he does in the Sonnets.

      CHAPTER VIII. SHAKESPEARE'S HUMOUR: FALSTAFF
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's portraits of himself are not to be mistaken; the changes in
      him caused by age bring into clearer light the indestructible
      individuality, and no difference of circumstance or position has any
      effect upon this distinctive character: whether he is the lover, Romeo;
      the murderer, Macbeth; the courtier, Hamlet; or the warrior, Posthumus; he
      is always the same&mdash;a gentle yet impulsive nature, sensuous at once
      and meditative; half poet, half philosopher, preferring nature and his own
      reveries to action and the life of courts; a man physically fastidious to
      disgust, as is a delicate woman, with dirt and smells and common things;
      an idealist daintily sensitive to all courtesies, chivalries, and
      distinctions. The portrait is not yet complete&mdash;far from it, indeed;
      but already it is manifest that Shakespeare's nature was so complex, so
      tremulously poised between world-wide poles of poetry and philosophy, of
      what is individual and concrete on the one hand and what is abstract and
      general on the other, that the task of revealing himself was singularly
      difficult. It is not easy even to describe him as he painted himself: it
      may be that, wishing to avoid a mere catalogue of disparate qualities, I
      have brought into too great prominence the gentle passionate side of
      Shakespeare's nature; though that would be difficult and in any case no
      bad fault; for this is the side which has hitherto been neglected or
      rather overlooked by the critics.
    </p>
    <p>
      My view of Shakespeare can be made clearer by examples. I began by taking
      Hamlet the philosopher as Shakespeare's most profound and complex study,
      and went on to prove that Hamlet is the most complete portrait which
      Shakespeare has given of himself, other portraits being as it were sides
      of Hamlet or less successful <i>replicas</i> of him; and finally I tried
      to complete the Hamlet by uniting him with Duke Orsino, Orsino the
      poet-lover being, so to speak, Shakespeare's easiest and most natural
      portrait. In Hamlet, if one may dare to say so, Shakespeare has discovered
      too much of himself: Hamlet is at one and the same time philosopher and
      poet, critic and courtier, lover and cynic&mdash;the extremes that
      Shakespeare's intellect could cover&mdash;and he fills every part so
      easily that he might almost be a bookish Admirable Crichton, a type of
      perfection rather than an individual man, were it not for his feminine
      gentleness and forgivingness of nature, and particularly for the brooding
      melancholy and disbelief which darkened Shakespeare's outlook at the time.
      But though the melancholy scepticism was an abiding characteristic of
      Shakespeare, to be found in his Richard II. as in his Prospero, it did not
      overshadow all his being as it does Hamlet's. There was a summer-time,
      too, in Shakespeare's life, and in his nature a capacity for sunny gaiety
      and a delight in life and love which came to full expression in the golden
      comedies, &ldquo;Much Ado,&rdquo; &ldquo;As You Like It&rdquo; and &ldquo;Twelfth Night.&rdquo; The complement
      to Hamlet the sad philosopher-sceptic is the sensuous happy poet-lover
      Orsino, and when we take these seeming antitheses and unite them we have a
      good portrait of Shakespeare. But these two, Hamlet and Orsino, are in
      reality one; every quality of Orsino is to be found or divined in Hamlet,
      and therefore the easiest and surest way to get at Shakespeare is to take
      Hamlet and deepen those peculiarities in him which we find in Orsino.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some critics are sure to say that I have now given a portrait of Coleridge
      rather than a portrait of Shakespeare. This is not altogether the fact,
      though I for one see no shame in acknowledging the likeness. Coleridge had
      a &ldquo;smack of Hamlet&rdquo; in him, as he himself saw; indeed, in his rich
      endowment as poet and philosopher, and in his gentleness and sweetness of
      disposition, he was more like Shakespeare than any other Englishman whom I
      can think of; but in Coleridge the poet soon disappeared, and a little
      later the philosopher in him faded into the visionary and sophist; he
      became an upholder of the English Church and found reasons in the
      immutable constitution of the universe for aprons and shovel-hats.
      Shakespeare, on the other hand, though similarly endowed, was far more
      richly endowed: he had stronger passions and greater depth of feeling; the
      sensuousness of Keats was in him; and this richness of nature not only
      made him a greater lyric poet than Coleridge and a far saner thinker, but
      carried him in spite of a constitutional dislike of resolve and action to
      his astounding achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even when we thus compare Shakespeare with Coleridge, as we compare
      trees of the same species, showing that as the roots of the one go deeper
      and take a firmer hold of earth, so in exact measure the crest rises into
      higher air, still there is something lacking to our comparison. Even when
      we hold Hamlet-Orsino before us as the best likeness of the master-poet,
      our impression of him is still incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remains a host of creations from Launce to Autolycus, and from Dame
      Quickly to Maria, which proves that Shakespeare was something more than
      the gentle lover-thinker-poet whom we have shown. It is Shakespeare's
      humour that differentiates him not only from Coleridge and Keats, but also
      from the world-poets, Goethe, Dante, and Homer. It is this unique
      endowment that brings him into vital touch with reality and common life,
      and hinders us from feeling his all-pervading ideality as disproportioned
      or one-sided. Strip him of his humour and he would have been seen long ago
      in his true proportions. His sympathies are not more broad and generous
      than Balzac's; his nature is too delicate, too sensitive, too sensuous;
      but his humour blinds us to the truth. Of course his comic characters,
      like his captains and men of action, are due originally to his faculty of
      observation; but while his observation of the fighting men is always
      superficial and at times indifferent, his humorous observation is so
      intensely interested and sympathetic that its creations are only inferior
      in artistic value to his portraits of the poet-philosopher-lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intellect in him had little or nothing to go upon in the case of the
      man of action; he never loved the Captain or watched him at work; it is
      his mind and second-hand knowledge that made Henry V. and Richard III.;
      and how slight and shallow are these portraits in comparison with the
      portrait of a Parolles or a Sir Toby Belch, or the ever-famous Nurse,
      where the same intellect has played about the humorous trait and
      heightened the effect of loving observation. The critics who have
      ignorantly praised his Hotspur and Bastard as if he had been a man of
      deeds as well as a man of words have only obscured the truth that
      Shakespeare the poet-philosopher, the lover <i>quand même</i>, only
      reached a sane balance of nature through his overflowing humour. He whose
      intellect and sensibilities inspired him with nothing but contempt and
      loathing for the mass of mankind, the aristocrat who in a dozen plays
      sneers at the greasy caps and foul breaths of the multitude, fell in love
      with Dogberry, and Bottom, Quickly and Tearsheet, clod and clown, pimp and
      prostitute, for the laughter they afforded. His humour is rarely sardonic;
      it is almost purged of contempt; a product not of hate but of love; full
      of sympathy; summer-lightning humour, harmless and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the sympathy fails and the laughter grows grim, and these lapses
      are characteristic. He hates false friends and timeservers, the whole
      tribe of the ungrateful, the lords of Timon's acquaintance and his
      artists; he loathes Shylock, whose god is greed and who battens on others'
      misfortunes; he laughs at the self-righteous Malvolio and not with him,
      and takes pleasure in unmasking the pretended ascetic and Puritan Angelo;
      but for the frailties of the flesh he has an ever-ready forgiveness. Like
      the greatest of ethical teachers, he can take the publican and the sinner
      to his heart, but not the hypocrite or the Pharisee or the money-lender.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not come within the scope of this essay to attempt a detailed
      criticism of Shakespeare's comic characters; it will be enough for my
      purpose to show that even in his masterpiece of humour, the incomparable
      Falstaff, he betrays himself more than once: more than once we shall find
      Shakespeare, the poet, or Shakespeare, the thinker, speaking through
      Falstaff's mouth. Yet to criticize Falstaff is difficult, and if easy, it
      would still be an offence to those capable of gratitude. I would as soon
      find fault with Ariel's most exquisite lyric, or the impeccable loveliness
      of the &ldquo;Dove Sono,&rdquo; as weigh the rich words of the Lord of Comedy in small
      balances of reason. But such considerations must not divert me from my
      purpose; I have undertaken to discover the very soul of Shakespeare, and I
      must, therefore, trace him in Falstaff as in Hamlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Falstaff enters and asks the Prince the time. The Prince answers that
      unless &ldquo;hours were cups of sack and so forth, he can't understand why
      Falstaff should care about anything so superfluous as time.&rdquo; Falstaff
      replies: &ldquo;Indeed you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go by
      the moon and the seven stars and not by Phoebus, he, 'that wandering
      knight so fair.'&rdquo; Here we have a sort of lyrical strain in Falstaff and
      then a tag of poetry which gives food for thought; but his next speech is
      unmistakable:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Let us be Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade,
  minions of the moon; and let men say we be men of
  good government, being governed, as the sea is, by our
  noble and chaste mistress, the moon, under whose
  countenance we&mdash;steal.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is Shakespeare speaking, and Shakespeare alone: the phrases sing to
      us in the unmistakable music of the master-poet, though the fall at the
      last to &ldquo;&mdash;steal,&rdquo; seems to be an attempt to get into the character
      of Falstaff. It is, of course, difficult to make the first words of a
      person sharply characteristic; a writer is apt to work himself into a new
      character gradually; it is only the sensitive self-consciousness of our
      time that demands an absolute fidelity in characterization from the first
      word to the last. Yet this scene is so excellent and natural, that the
      uncertainty in the painting of Falstaff strikes me as peculiar. But this
      first speech is not the only speech of Falstaff in which Shakespeare
      betrays himself; again and again we catch the very accent of the poet. It
      is not Falstaff but Shakespeare who says that &ldquo;the poor abuses of the time
      want countenance&rdquo;; and later in the play, when the character of Falstaff
      is fully developed, it is Shakespeare, the thinker, who calls Falstaff's
      ragged regiment &ldquo;the cankers of a calm world and a long peace.&rdquo; In just
      the same way Hamlet speaks of the expedition of Fortinbras:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
  That inward breaks.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But though the belief that Shakespeare sometimes falls out of the
      character and slips phrases of his own into Falstaff's mouth is
      well-founded, it should nevertheless be put aside as a heresy, for the
      true faith is that the white-bearded old footpad who cheered on his
      fellow-ruffians with
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Strike.... Bacon-fed knaves! they hate us youth:
  down with them! fleece them!&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
and again:
  &ldquo;On, bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men
  must live!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      is the most splendid piece of humorous portraiture in the world's fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who but Falstaff would have found his self-justification in his youth?&mdash;<i>splendide
      mendax</i>! and yet the excuse is as true to his sack-heated blood when he
      uses it on Gadshill as it was true also to fact when he first used it
      forty years before. And who but Falstaff would have had the words of
      repentance always on his lips and never in his heart? I ascribe these
      illuminating flashes to Falstaff, and not to Shakespeare, for no
      imagination in the world has yet accomplished such a miracle; as a miracle
      of representment Falstaff is astonishing enough, as a miracle of creation
      he is simply unthinkable. I would almost as soon believe that Falstaff
      made Shakespeare as that Shakespeare made Falstaff without a living model.
      All hail to thee, inimitable, incomparable Jack! Never before or since has
      poet been blessed with such a teacher, as rich and laughterful, as
      mendacious and corrupting as life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must not be taken to mean that the living original of Falstaff was as
      richly humorous, as inexhaustibly diverting as the dramatic counterfeit
      who is now a citizen and chief personage in that world of literature which
      outlasts all the fleeting shows of the so-called real world. It seems to
      me to be possible for a good reader to notice not only Shakespeare's
      lapses and faults in the drawing of this character, but also to make a
      very fair guess at his heightening touches, and so arrive at last at the
      humorous old lewdster who furnished the living model for the inimitable
      portrait. The first scene in which Falstaff appears talking with Prince
      Henry will supply examples to illustrate my meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Falstaff's very first speech after he asks Hal the time of day gives us
      the key; he ends it with:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And I pr'ythee, sweet wag, when thou art king,&mdash;as,
  God save thy grace&mdash;majesty, I should say, for grace
  thou wilt have none,&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here he is interrupted and breaks off, but a minute or two later he comes
      back again to his argument, and curiously enough uses exactly the same
      words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;But, I pr'ythee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows
  standing in England when thou art king? and resolution
  thus fobbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father
  Antick, the law?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Now, this question and the hope it expresses that justice would be put to
      shame in England on Prince Henry's accession to the throne is taken from a
      speech of the Prince in the old play, &ldquo;The Famous Victories of Henry the
      Fifth.&rdquo; Shakespeare would have done better to leave it out, for Falstaff
      has far too good brains to imagine that all thieves could ever have his
      licence and far too much conceit ever to desire so unholy a consummation.
      And Shakespeare must have felt that the borrowed words were too
      shallow-common, for he immediately falls back on his own brains for the
      next phrase and gives us of his hoarded best. The second part of the
      question, &ldquo;resolution thus fobbed,&rdquo; and so forth, is only another
      statement of the famous couplet in &ldquo;Richard III.&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
  Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      These faults show that Shakespeare is at first unsure of his personage; he
      fumbles a little; yet the vivacity, the roaring life, is certainly a
      quality of the original Falstaff, for it attends him as constantly as his
      shadow; the pun, too, is his, and the phrase &ldquo;sweet wag&rdquo; is probably taken
      from his mouth, for he repeats it again, &ldquo;sweet wag,&rdquo; and again &ldquo;mad wag.&rdquo;
       The shamelessness, too, and the lechery are marks of him, and the love of
      witty word-warfare, and, above all, the pretended repentance:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art, indeed,
  able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm
  upon me, Hal,&mdash;God forgive thee for it. Before I knew
  thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
  should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked.
  I must give over this life, and I will give it over; by the
  Lord, an I do not, I am a villain; I'll be damned for
  never a king's son in Christendom.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In this first scene between Falstaff and Prince Henry, Shakespeare is
      feeling his way, so to speak, blindfold to Falstaff, with gropings of
      memory and dashes of poetry that lead him past the mark. In this first
      scene, as we noticed, he puts fine lyric phrases in Falstaff's mouth; but
      he never repeats the experiment; Falstaff and high poetry are anti-podes&mdash;all
      of which merely proves that at first Shakespeare had not got into the skin
      of his personage. But the real Falstaff had probably tags of verse in
      memory and lilts of song, for Shakespeare repeats this trait. Here we
      reach the test: Whenever a feature is accentuated by repetition, we may
      guess that it belongs to the living model. There was assuredly a strong
      dash of Puritanism in the real Falstaff, for when Shakespeare comes to
      render this, he multiplies the brush-strokes with perfect confidence;
      Falstaff is perpetually repenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first scene Shakespeare seems to have made up his mind to keep
      closely to his model and only to permit himself heightening touches.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to come closer to the original, I will now take another passage
      later in the play, when Shakespeare is drawing Falstaff with a sure hand:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Fal</i>. A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance
  too! marry and amen!&mdash;Give me a cup of sack, boy.&mdash;
  Ere I lead this life long, I'll sew netherstocks, and mend
  them, and foot them, too. A plague of all cowards!&mdash;
  give me a cup of sack, rogue.&mdash;Is there no virtue extant?
                                     {<i>Drinks</i>.}&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here is surely the true Falstaff; he will not lead this life long; this is
      the soul of him; but the exquisite heightening phrase, &ldquo;Is there no virtue
      extant?&rdquo; is pure Shakespeare, Shakespeare generalizing as we saw him
      generalizing in just the same way in the scene where Cade is talked of in
      the Second Part of &ldquo;King Henry VI.&rdquo; The form too is Shakespeare's. Who
      does not remember the magic line in &ldquo;The Two Noble Kinsmen &ldquo;?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;She is all the beauty extant.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And the next speech of Falstaff is just as illuminating:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;<i>Fal</i>. You rogue, here's lime in this sack, too; there is
   nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man: yet a coward
   is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it&mdash;a villainous
   coward.&mdash;Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou wilt, if manhood,
   good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I
   a shotten herring. There live not three good men unhanged in
   England, and one of them is fat and grows old: God help the
   while! A bad world I say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At the beginning the concrete fact, then generalization, and then merely a
      repetition of the traits marked in the first scene, with the addition of
      bragging. Evidently Shakespeare has the model in memory as he writes. I
      say &ldquo;evidently,&rdquo; for Falstaff is the only character in Shakespeare that
      repeats the same words with damnable iteration, and in whom the same
      traits are shown again and again and again. When Shakespeare is painting
      himself in Richard II. he depicts irresolution again and again as he
      depicts it also in Hamlet; but neither Hamlet nor Richard repeats the same
      words, nor is any trait in either of them accentuated so grossly as are
      the principal traits of Falstaff's character. The features in Falstaff
      which are so harped upon, are to me the features of the original model.
      Shakespeare did not know Falstaff quite as well as he knew himself; so he
      has to confine himself to certain qualities which he had observed, and
      stick, besides, to certain tags of speech, which were probably favourites
      with the living man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another important particular, too, Falstaff is unlike any other comic
      character in Shakespeare: he tells the truth about himself in a magical
      way. The passage I allude to is the first speech made by Falstaff in the
      Second Part of &ldquo;Henry IV.&rdquo;; it shows us Shakespeare getting into the
      character again&mdash;after a certain lapse of time:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Fal</i>. Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me; the
  brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able
  to invent anything that tends to laughter, more than I
  invent or is invented on me: I am not only witty in myself,
  but the cause that wit is in other men&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Just as in the first act Shakespeare introducing Falstaff makes him talk
      poetically, so here there is a certain exaltation and lyrical swing which
      betrays the poet-creator. &ldquo;Foolish-compounded,&rdquo; too, shows Shakespeare's
      hand, but the boast, I feel sure, was a boast often made by the original,
      and thus brings Shakespeare into intimate union with the character; for
      after this introduction Falstaff goes on to talk pure Falstaff, unmixed
      with any slightest dash of poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was the original of Falstaff? Is a guess possible? It seems to me it
      must have been some lover of poetry&mdash;perhaps Chettle, the Chettle who
      years before had published Greene's attack upon Shakespeare and who
      afterwards made amends for it. In Dekker's tract, &ldquo;A Knight's Conjuring,&rdquo;
       Chettle figures among the poets in Elysium: &ldquo;In comes Chettle sweating and
      blowing by reason of his fatnes; to welcome whom, because hee was of olde
      acquaintance, all rose up, and fell presentlie on their knees, to drinck a
      health to all the louers of Hellicon.&rdquo; Here we have a fat man greeted with
      laughter and mock reverence by the poets&mdash;just such a model as
      Shakespeare needed, but the guess is mere conjecture: we don't know enough
      about Chettle to be at all sure. Yet Chettle was by way of being a poet,
      and Falstaff uses tags of verse&mdash;still, as I say, it is all pure
      guesswork. The only reason I put his name forward is that some have talked
      of Ben Jonson as Falstaff's original merely because he was fat. I cannot
      believe that gentle Shakespeare would ever have treated Jonson with such
      contempt; but Chettle seems to have been a butt by nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Falstaff was taken from one model is to me certain. Shakespeare very
      seldom tells us what his characters look like; whenever he gives us a
      photograph, so to speak, of a person, it is always taken from life and
      extraordinarily significant. We have several portraits of Falstaff: the
      Prince gives a picture of the &ldquo;old fat man,...&rdquo; that trunk of humours &ldquo;...
      that old white-bearded Satan&rdquo;; the Chief Justice gives us another of his
      &ldquo;moist eye, white beard, increasing belly and double chin.&rdquo; Falstaff
      himself has another: &ldquo;a goodly portly man, i' faith and a corpulent; of a
      cheerful look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage.&rdquo; Such physical
      portraiture alone would convince me that there was a living model for
      Falstaff. But there are more obvious arguments: the other humorous
      characters of Shakespeare are infinitely inferior to Falstaff, and the
      best of them are merely sides of Falstaff or poor reflections of him.
      Autolycus and Parolles have many of his traits, but they are not old, and
      taken together, they are only a faint <i>replica</i> of the immortal
      footpad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listening with my heart in my ears, I catch a living voice, a round, fat
      voice with tags of &ldquo;pr'ythee,&rdquo; &ldquo;wag,&rdquo; and &ldquo;marry,&rdquo; and behind the
      inimitable dramatic counterfeit I see a big man with a white head and
      round belly who loved wine and women and jovial nights, a Triton among the
      minnows of boon companions, whose shameless effrontery was backed by
      cunning, whose wit though common was abundant and effective through long
      practice&mdash;a sort of licensed tavern-king, whose mere entrance into a
      room set the table in a roar. Shakespeare was attracted by the many-sided
      racy ruffian, delighted perhaps most by his easy mastery of life and men;
      he studied him with infinite zest, absorbed him wholly, and afterwards
      reproduced him with such richness of sympathy, such magic of enlarging
      invention that he has become, so to speak, the symbol of laughter
      throughout the world, for men of all races the true Comic Muse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case I may be allowed one last argument. The Falstaff of &ldquo;The Merry
      Wives of Windsor&rdquo; is not the Falstaff of the two parts of &ldquo;King Henry
      IV.&rdquo;; it is but a shadow of the great knight that we see, an echo of him
      that we hear in the later comedy. Falstaff would never have written the
      same letter to Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page; there was too much fancy in him,
      too much fertility, too much delight in his own mind- and word-wealth ever
      to show himself so painfully stinted and barren. Nor is it credible that
      Falstaff would ever have fallen three times running into the same trap;
      Falstaff made traps; he did not fall into them. We know, too, that
      Falstaff would not fight &ldquo;longer than he saw reason&rdquo;; his instinct of
      self-preservation was largely developed; but he could face a sword; he
      drew on Pistol and chased him from the room; he was not such a pitiful
      coward as to take Ford's cudgelling. Finally, the Falstaff whom we all
      know could never have been befooled by the Welshman and his child-fairies.
      And this objection Shakespeare himself felt, for he meets it by making
      Falstaff explain how near he came to discovering the fraud, and how wit is
      made &ldquo;a Jack-a-Lent when 'tis upon ill employment.&rdquo; But the fact that some
      explanation is necessary is an admission of the fault. Falstaff must
      indeed have laid his brains in the sun before he could have been taken in
      by foppery so gross and palpable. This is not the same man who at once
      recognized the Prince and Poins through their disguise as drawers. Yet
      there are moments when the Falstaff of &ldquo;The Merry Wives&rdquo; resumes his old
      nature. For example, when he is accused by Pistol of sharing in the
      proceeds of the theft, he answers with all the old shameless wit:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Reason, you rogue, reason; think'st thou I'll endanger
  my soul gratis?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and, again, when he has been cozened and beaten, he speaks almost in the
      old way:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I never prospered since I forswore myself at primero.
  Well, if my wind were but long enough to say my
  prayers, I would repent.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But on the whole the Falstaff of &ldquo;The Merry Wives&rdquo; is but a poor thin
      shadow of the Falstaff of the two parts of &ldquo;Henry IV.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had &ldquo;The Merry Wives&rdquo; been produced under ordinary conditions, one would
      have had to rack one's brains to account for its feebleness. Not only is
      the genial Lord of Humour degraded in it into a buffoon, but the amusement
      of it is chiefly in situation; it is almost as much a farce as a comedy.
      For these and other reasons I believe in the truth of the tradition that
      Elizabeth was so pleased with the character of Falstaff that she ordered
      Shakespeare to write another play showing the fat knight in love, and that
      in obedience to this command Shakespeare wrote &ldquo;The Merry Wives&rdquo; in a
      fortnight. For what does a dramatist do when he is in a hurry to strike
      while the iron is hot and to catch a Queen's fancy before it changes?
      Naturally he goes to his memory for his characters, to that vivid memory
      of youth which makes up by precision of portraiture for what it lacks in
      depth of comprehension. And this is the distinguishing characteristic of
      &ldquo;The Merry Wives,&rdquo; particularly in the beginning. Even without &ldquo;the dozen
      white luces&rdquo; in his coat, one would swear that this Justice Shallow, with
      his pompous pride of birth and his stilted stupidity, is a portrait from
      life, some Sir Thomas Lucy or other, and Justice Shallow is not so deeply
      etched in as his cousin, Master Slender&mdash;&ldquo;a little wee face, with a
      little yellow beard,&mdash;a cane-coloured beard.&rdquo; Such physical
      portraiture, as I have said, is very rare and very significant in
      Shakespeare. This photograph is slightly malevolent, too, as of one whose
      malice is protected by a Queen's commission. Those who do not believe
      traditions when thus circumstantially supported would not believe though
      one rose from the dead to witness to them. &ldquo;The Merry Wives&rdquo; is worthful
      to me as the only piece of Shakespeare's journalism that we possess; here
      we find him doing task-work, and doing it at utmost speed. Those who wish
      to measure the difference between the conscious, deliberate work of the
      artist and the hurried slap-dash performance of the journalist, have only
      to compare the Falstaff of &ldquo;The Merry Wives&rdquo; with the Falstaff of the two
      parts of &ldquo;Henry IV.&rdquo; But if we take it for granted that &ldquo;The Merry Wives&rdquo;
       was done in haste and to order, can any inference be fairly drawn from the
      feebleness of Falstaff and the unreality of his love-making? I think so;
      it seems to me that, if Falstaff had been a creation, Shakespeare must
      have reproduced him more effectively. His love-making in the second part
      of &ldquo;Henry IV.&rdquo; is real enough. But just because Falstaff was taken from
      life, and studied from the outside, Shakespeare having painted him once
      could not paint him again, he had exhausted his model and could only echo
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart of the matter is that, whereas Shakespeare's men of action, when
      he is not helped by history or tradition, are thinly conceived and poorly
      painted, his comic characters&mdash;Falstaff, Sir Toby Belch, and
      Dogberry; Maria, Dame Quickly, and the Nurse, creatures of observation
      though they be, are only inferior as works of art to the portraits of
      himself which he has given us in Romeo, Hamlet, Macbeth, Orsino, and
      Posthumus. It is his humour which makes Shakespeare the greatest of
      dramatists, the most complete of men.

      CHAPTER I. SHAKESPEARE'S EARLY ATTEMPTS TO PORTRAY HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE:
      BIRON, ADRIANA, VALENTINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the preceding chapters I have considered those impersonations of
      Shakespeare which revealed most distinctly the salient features of his
      character. I now regard this part of my work as finished: the outlines at
      least of his nature are established beyond dispute, and I may therefore be
      permitted to return upon my steps, and beginning with the earliest works
      pass in review most of the other personages who discover him, however
      feebly or profoundly. Hitherto I have rather challenged contradiction than
      tried to conciliate or persuade; it was necessary to convince the reader
      that Shakespeare was indeed Hamlet-Orsino, plus an exquisite sense of
      humour; and as the proofs of this were almost inexhaustible, and as the
      stability of the whole structure depended on the firmness of the
      foundations, I was more than willing to call forth opposition in order
      once for all to strangle doubt. But now that I have to put in the finer
      traits of the portrait I have to hope for the goodwill at least of my
      readers. Even then my task is not easy. The subtler traits of a man's
      character often elude accurate description, to say nothing of exact proof;
      the differences in tone between a dramatist's own experiences of life and
      his observation of the experiences of others are often so slight as to be
      all but unnoticeable. In the case of some peculiarities I have only a mere
      suggestion to go upon, in that of others a bare surmise, a hint so
      fleeting that it may well seem to the judicious as if the meshes of
      language were too coarse to catch such evanescent indication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately in this work I am not called on to limit myself to that which
      can be proved beyond question, or to the ordinary man. I think my reader
      will allow me, or indeed expect me, now to throw off constraint and finish
      my picture as I please.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this second book then I shall try to correct Shakespeare's portraits of
      himself by bringing out his concealed faults and vices&mdash;the
      shortcomings one's vanity slurs over and omits. Above all I shall try to
      notice anything that throws light upon his life, for I have to tell here
      the story of his passion and his soul's wreck. At the crisis of his life
      he revealed himself almost without affectation; in agony men forget to
      pose. And this more intimate understanding of the man will enable us to
      reconstruct, partially at least, the happenings of his life, and so trace
      not only his development, but the incidents of his life's journey from his
      school days in 1575 till he crept home to Stratford to die nearly forty
      years later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief academic critics, such as Professor Dowden and Dr. Brandes, take
      pains to inform us that Biron in &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo; is nothing but an
      impersonation of Shakespeare. This would show much insight on the part of
      the Professors were it not that Coleridge as usual has been before them,
      and that Coleridge's statement is to be preferred to theirs. Coleridge was
      careful to say that the whole play revealed many of Shakespeare's
      characteristic features, and he added finely, &ldquo;as in a portrait taken of
      him in his boyhood.&rdquo; This is far truer than Dowden's more precise
      statement that &ldquo;Berowne is the exponent of Shakespeare's own thought.&rdquo; For
      though, of course, Biron is especially the mouthpiece of the poet, yet
      Shakespeare reveals himself in the first speech of the King as clearly as
      he does in any speech of Biron:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Let Fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
  Live registered upon our brazen tombs,
  And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
  When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
  The endeavour of this present breath may buy
  That honour which shall 'bate his scythe's keen edge,
  And make us heirs of all eternity.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The King's criticism, too, of Armado in the first scene is more finely
      characteristic of Shakespeare than Biron's criticism of Boyet in the last
      act. In this, his first drama, Shakespeare can hardly sketch a sympathetic
      character without putting something of himself into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I regard &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo; as Shakespeare's earliest comedy, not only
      because the greater part of it is in rhymed verse, but also because he was
      unable in it to individualize his serious personages at all; the comic
      characters, on the other hand, are already carefully observed and
      distinctly differenced. Biron himself is scarcely more than a charming
      sketch: he is almost as interested in language as in love, and he plays
      with words till they revenge themselves by obscuring his wit; he is filled
      with the high spirits of youth; in fact, he shows us the form and pressure
      of the Renaissance as clearly as the features of Shakespeare. It is,
      however, Biron-Shakespeare, who understands that the real world is built
      on broader natural foundations than the King's womanless Academe, and
      therefore predicts the failure of the ascetic experiment. Another trait in
      Biron that brings us close to Shakespeare is his contempt for
      book-learning;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Small have continual plodders ever won
  Save bare authority from others' books.
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
  And every godfather can give a name.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again and again he returns to the charge:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  &ldquo;To study now it is too late,
  Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The summing up is triumphant:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;So, study evermore is overshot.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In fine, Biron ridicules study at such length and with such earnestness
      and pointed phrase that it is manifest the discussion was intensely
      interesting to Shakespeare himself. But we should have expected
      Shakespeare's <i>alter ego</i> to be arguing on the other side; for again
      and again we have had to notice that Shakespeare was a confirmed lover of
      books; he was always using bookish metaphors, and Hamlet was a student by
      nature. This attitude on the part of Biron, then, calls for explanation,
      and it seems to me that the only possible explanation is to be found in
      Shakespeare's own experience. Those who know England as she was in the
      days of Elizabeth, or as she is to-day, will hardly need to be told that
      when Shakespeare first came to London he was regarded as an unlettered
      provincial (&ldquo;with little Latin and less Greek&rdquo;), and had to bear the mocks
      and flouts of his beschooled fellows, who esteemed learning and gentility
      above genius. In his very first independent play he answered the scorners
      with scorn. But this disdain of study was not Shakespeare's real feeling;
      and his natural loyalty to the deeper truth forced him to make Biron
      contradict and excuse his own argument in a way which seems to me
      altogether charming; but is certainly undramatic:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&mdash;Though I have for barbarism spoke more
  Than for that angel knowledge you can say.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Undramatic the declaration is because it is at war with the length and
      earnestness with which Biron has maintained his contempt for learning; but
      here undoubtedly we find the true Shakespeare who as a youth speaks of
      &ldquo;that angel, knowledge,&rdquo; just as in &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo; twenty years later he
      calls reverence, &ldquo;that angel of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we come to his &ldquo;Life&rdquo; we shall see that Shakespeare, who was thrown
      into the scrimmage of existence as a youth, and had to win his own way in
      the world, had, naturally enough, a much higher opinion of books and
      book-learning than Goethe, who was bred a student and knew life only as an
      amateur:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Einen Blick in's Buch hinein und zwei in's Leben
  Das muss die rechte Form dem Geiste geben.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare would undoubtedly have given &ldquo;two glances&rdquo; to books and one to
      life, had he been free to choose; but perhaps after all Goethe was right
      in warning us that life is more valuable to the artist than any transcript
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to our theme; Biron is not among Shakespeare's successful
      portraits of himself. As might be expected in a first essay, the drawing
      is now over-minute, now too loose. When Biron talks of study, he reveals,
      as we have seen, personal feelings that are merely transient; on the other
      hand, when he talks about Boyet he talks merely to hear &ldquo;the music of his
      own vain tongue.&rdquo; He is, however, always nimble-witted and impulsive;
      &ldquo;quick Biron&rdquo; as the Princess calls him, a gentleman of charming manners,
      of incomparable fluent, graceful, and witty speech, which qualities
      afterwards came to blossom in Mercutio and Gratiano. The faults in
      portraiture are manifestly due to inexperience: Shakespeare was still too
      youthful-timid to paint his chief features boldly, and it is left for
      Rosaline to picture Biron for us as Shakespeare doubtless desired to
      appear:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              &ldquo;A merrier man,
  Within the limits of becoming mirth,
  I never spent an hour's talk withal.
  His eye begets occasion for his wit;
  For every object that the one doth catch,
  The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
  Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
  Delivers in such apt and gracious words
  That agèd ears play truant at his tales,
  And younger hearings are quite ravishèd,
  So sweet and voluble is his discourse.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Every touch of this self-painted portrait deserves to be studied: it is
      the first photograph of our poet which we possess&mdash;a photograph, too,
      taken in early manhood. Shakespeare's wit we knew, his mirth too, and that
      his conversation was voluble and sweet enough to ravish youthful ears and
      enthrall the aged we might have guessed from Jonson's report. But it is
      delightful to hear of his mirth-moving words and to know that he regarded
      himself as the best talker in the world. But just as the play at the end
      turns from love-making and gay courtesies to thoughts of death and
      &ldquo;world-without-end&rdquo; pledges, so Biron's merriment is only the
      effervescence of youth, and love brings out in him Shakespeare's
      characteristic melancholy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;By heaven, I do love, and it hath taught me to
  rhyme, and to be melancholy.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again and again, as in his apology to Rosaline and his appeal at the end
      of the play to &ldquo;honest plain words,&rdquo; he shows a deep underlying
      seriousness. The soul of quick talkative mirthful Biron is that he loves
      beauty whether of women or of words, and though he condemns &ldquo;taffeta
      phrases,&rdquo; he shows his liking for the &ldquo;silken terms precise&rdquo; in the very
      form of his condemnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course all careful readers know that the greater seriousness of the
      last two acts of &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost,&rdquo; and the frequent use of blank
      verse instead of rhymed verse in them, are due to the fact that
      Shakespeare revised the play in 1597, some eight or nine years probably
      after he had first written it. Every one must have noticed the repetitions
      in Biron's long speech at the end of the fourth act, which show the
      original garment and the later, finer embroidery. As I shall have to
      return to this revision for other reasons, it will be enough here to
      remark that it is especially the speeches of Biron which Shakespeare
      improved in the second handling
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Brandes, or rather Coleridge, tells us that in Biron and his Rosaline
      we have the first hesitating sketch of the masterly Benedick and Beatrice
      of &ldquo;Much Ado about Nothing&rdquo;; but in this I think Coleridge goes too far.
      Unformed as Biron is, he is Shakespeare in early youth, whereas in
      Benedick the likeness is not by any means so clear. In fact, Benedick is
      merely an admirable stage silhouette and needs to be filled out with an
      actor's personality. Beatrice, on the other hand, is a woman of a very
      distinct type, whereas Rosaline needs pages of explanation, which
      Coleridge never dreamed of. A certain similarity rather of situation than
      of character seems to have misled Coleridge in this instance. Boyet jests
      with Maria and Rosaline just as Biron does, and just as Benedick jests
      with Beatrice: all these scenes simply show how intensely young
      Shakespeare enjoyed a combat of wits, spiced with the suggestiveness that
      nearly always shows itself when the combatants are of different sexes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is almost certain that &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo; was wholly conceived and
      constructed as well as written by Shakespeare; no play or story has yet
      been found which might, in this case, have served him as a model. For the
      first and probably the last time he seems to have taken the entire drama
      from his imagination, and the result from a playwright's point of view is
      unfortunate; &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo; is his slightest and feeblest play. It
      is scarcely ever seen on the stage&mdash;is, indeed, practically
      unactable. This fact goes to confirm the view already put forth more than
      once in these pages, that Shakespeare was not a good playwright and took
      little or no interest in the external incidents of his dramas. The plot
      and action of the story, so carefully worked out by the ordinary
      playwright and so highly esteemed by critics and spectators, he always
      borrows, as if he had recognized the weakness of this first attempt, and
      when he sets himself to construct a play, it has no action, no plot&mdash;is,
      indeed, merely a succession of fantastic occurrences that give occasion
      for light love-making and brilliant talk. Even in regard to the grouping
      of characters the construction of his early plays is puerile, mechanical;
      in &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo; the King with his three courtiers is set against
      the Princess and her three ladies; in &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; there
      is the faithful Valentine opposed to the inconstant Proteus, and each of
      them has a comic servant; and when later his plays from this point of view
      were not manufactured but grew, and thus assumed the beautiful irregular
      symmetry of life, the incidents were still neglected. Neither the poet nor
      the philosopher in Shakespeare felt much of the child's interest in the
      story; he chose his tales for the sake of the characters and the poetry,
      and whether they were effective stage-tales or not troubled him but
      little. There is hardly more plot or action in &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; than in &ldquo;Love's
      Labour's Lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that &ldquo;The Comedy of Errors&rdquo; followed hard on the heels of
      &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost.&rdquo; It practically belongs to the same period: it has
      fewer lines of prose in it than &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo;; but, on the other
      hand, the intrigue-spinning is clever, and the whole play shows a riper
      knowledge of theatrical conditions. Perhaps because the intrigue is more
      interesting, the character-drawing is even feebler than that of the
      earlier comedy: indeed, so far as the men go there is hardly anything
      worth calling character-drawing at all. Shakespeare speaks through this or
      that mask as occasion tempts him: and if the women are sharply, crudely
      differentiated, it is because Shakespeare, as I shall show later, has
      sketched his wife for us in Adriana, and his view of her character is
      decided enough if not over kind. Still, any and every peculiarity of
      character deserves notice, for in these earliest works Shakespeare is
      compelled to use his personal experience, to tell us of his own life and
      his own feelings, not having any wider knowledge to draw upon. Every word,
      therefore, in these first comedies, is important to those who would learn
      the story of his youth and fathom the idiosyncrasies of his being. When
      AEgeon, in the opening scenes, tells the Duke about the shipwreck in which
      he is separated from his wife and child, he declares that he himself
      &ldquo;would gladly have embraced immediate death.&rdquo; No reason is given for this
      extraordinary contempt of living. It was the &ldquo;incessant weepings&rdquo; of his
      wife, the &ldquo;piteous plainings of the pretty babes,&rdquo; that forced him, he
      says, to exert himself. But wives don't weep incessantly in danger, nor
      are the &ldquo;piteous plainings of the pretty babes&rdquo; a feature of shipwreck; I
      find here a little picture of Shakespeare's early married life in
      Stratford&mdash;a snapshot of memory. AEgeon concludes his account by
      saying that his life was prolonged in order
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;To tell sad stories of my own mishaps&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;which reminds one of similar words used later by Richard II. This
      personal, melancholy note is here forced and false, for Aegeon surely
      lives in hope of finding his wife and child and not in order to tell of
      his misfortunes. Aegeon is evidently a breath of Shakespeare himself, and
      not more than a breath, because he only appears again when the play is
      practically finished. Deep-brooding melancholy was the customary habit of
      Shakespeare even in youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as in &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo; we find Shakespeare speaking first
      through the King and then more fully through the hero, Biron, so here he
      first speaks through Aegeon and then at greater length through the
      protagonist Antipholus of Syracuse. Antipholus is introduced to us as new
      come to Ephesus, and Shakespeare is evidently thinking of his own first
      day in London when he puts in his mouth these words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
  Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
  Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
  And then return and sleep within mine inn;
  For with long travel I am stiff and weary.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Though &ldquo;stiff and weary&rdquo; he is too eager-young to rest; he will see
      everything&mdash;even &ldquo;peruse the traders&rdquo;&mdash;how the bookish metaphor
      always comes to Shakespeare's lips!&mdash;before he will eat or sleep. The
      utterly needless last line, with its emphatic description&mdash;&ldquo;stiff and
      weary&rdquo;&mdash;corroborates my belief that Shakespeare in this passage is
      telling us what he himself felt and did on his first arrival in London. In
      the second scene of the third act Antipholus sends his servant to the
      port:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I will not harbour in this town to-night
  If any bark put forth.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      From the fact that Shakespeare represented Antipholus to himself as
      wishing to leave Ephesus by sea, it is probable that he pictured him
      coming to Ephesus in a ship. But when Shakespeare begins to tell us what
      he did on reaching London he recalls his own desires and then his own
      feelings; he was &ldquo;stiff and weary&rdquo; on that first day because he rode, or
      more probably walked, into London; one does not become &ldquo;stiff and weary&rdquo;
       on board ship. This is another snapshot at that early life of Shakespeare,
      and his arrival in London, which one would not willingly miss. And surely
      it is the country-bred lad from Stratford who, fearing all manner of
      town-tricks, speaks in this way:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;They say this town is full of cozenage;
  As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
  Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
  Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
  Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
  And many such-like liberties of sin:
       - -       - -       - -       - -
  I greatly fear my money is not safe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This Antipholus is most ingenuous-talkative; without being questioned he
      tells about his servant:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A trusty villain, sir; that very oft,
  When I am dull with care and melancholy,
  Lightens my humour with his merry jests.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And as if this did not mark his peculiar thoughtful temperament
      sufficiently, he tells the merchant:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  &ldquo;I will go lose myself,
  And wander up and down to view the city.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And when the merchant leaves him, commending him to his own content, he
      talks to himself in this strain:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;He that commends me to mine own content,
  Commends me to the thing I cannot get,
         - -       - -        - -        - -       - -
  So I, to find a mother and a brother,
  In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A most curious way, it must be confessed, to seek for any one; but
      perfectly natural to the refined, melancholy, meditative, book-loving
      temperament which was already Shakespeare's. In this &ldquo;unhappy&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;mother&rdquo; I think I hear an echo of Shakespeare's sorrow at parting from
      his own mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Antipholus, although very free and open, has a reserve of dignity, as
      we see in the second scene of the second act, when he talks with his
      servant, who, as he thinks, has played with him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Because that I familiarly sometimes
  Do use you for my fool, and chat with you,
  Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
  And make a common of my serious hours.
  When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
  But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The self-esteem seems a little exaggerated here; but, after all, it is
      only natural; the whole scene is taken from Shakespeare's experience: the
      man who will chat familiarly with his servant, and jest with him as well,
      must expect to have to pull him up at times rather sharply. Antipholus
      proceeds to play with his servant in a fencing match of wit&mdash;a
      practice Shakespeare seems to have delighted in. But it is when Antipholus
      falls in love with Luciana that he shows us Shakespeare at his most
      natural as a lover. Luciana has just taken him to task for not loving her
      sister Adriana, who, she thinks, is his wife. Antipholus answers her thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Sweet mistress,&mdash;what your name is else, I know not,
  Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,&mdash;
  Less in your knowledge and your face you show not,
  Than our earth's wonder; more than earth divine,
  Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
  Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
  The folded meaning of your words' deceit. ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He declares, in fact, that he loves her and not her sister:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
  Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
  And as a bed I'll take them and there lie;
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
  Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And as if this were not enough he goes on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
  My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The word-conceits were a fashion of the time; but in spite of the verbal
      affectation, the courting shows the cunning of experience, and has,
      besides, a sort of echo of sincere feeling. How Shakespeare delights in
      making love! It reminds one of the first flutings of a thrush in early
      spring; over and over again he tries the notes with delighted iteration
      till he becomes a master of his music and charms the copses to silence
      with his song: and so Shakespeare sings of love again and again till at
      length we get the liquid notes of passion and the trills of joy all
      perfected in &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo;; but the voice is the voice we heard
      before in &ldquo;Venus and Adonis&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Comedy of Errors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antipholus' other appearances are not important. He merely fills his part
      till in the last scene he assures Luciana that he will make good his
      earlier protestations of love; but so far as he has any character at all,
      or distinctive individuality, he is young Shakespeare himself and his
      experiences are Shakespeare's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now a word or two about Adriana. Shakespeare makes her a jealous, nagging,
      violent scold, who will have her husband arrested for debt, though she
      will give money to free him. But the comedy of the play would be better
      brought out if Adriana were pictured as loving and constant, inflicting
      her inconvenient affection upon the false husband as upon the true. Why
      did Shakespeare want to paint this unpleasant bitter-tongued wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Adriana appears in the first scene of the second act she is at once
      sketched in her impatience and jealousy. She wants to know why her husband
      should have more liberty than she has, and declares that none but asses
      will be bridled so. Then she will strike her servant. In the first five
      minutes of this act she is sketched to the life, and Shakespeare does
      nothing afterwards but repeat and deepen the same strokes: it seems as if
      he knew nothing about her or would depict nothing of her except her
      jealousy and nagging, her impatience and violence. We have had occasion to
      notice more than once that when Shakespeare repeats touches in this way,
      he is drawing from life, from memory, and not from imagination. Moreover,
      in this case, he shows us at once that he is telling of his wife, because
      she defends herself against the accusation of age, which no one brings
      against her, though every one knows that Shakespeare's wife was eight
      years older than himself.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;His company must do his minions grace,
  Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
  Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
  From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it ...
    ... My decayed fair
  A sunny look of his would soon repair:
  But, poor unruly deer, he breaks the pale,
  And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The appeal is pathetic; but Luciana will not see it. She cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the second scene of this second act Adriana goes on nagging in almost
      the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second scene of the third act there is a phrase from the hero,
      Antipholus of Syracuse, about Adriana which I find significant:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;She that doth call me husband, even my soul
  Doth for a wife abhor!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There is no reason in the comedy for such strong words. Most men would be
      amused or pleased by a woman who makes up to them as Adriana makes up to
      Antipholus. I hear Shakespeare in this uncalled-for, over-emphatic &ldquo;even
      my soul doth for a wife abhor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the fifth act Adriana is brought before the Abbess, and is proved to be
      a jealous scold. Shakespeare will not be satisfied till some impartial
      great person of Adriana's own sex has condemned her. Adriana admits that
      she has scolded her husband in public and in private, too; the Abbess
      replies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And thereof came it that the man was mad.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And she adds:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The venom clamours of a jealous woman
  Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again, a needlessly emphatic condemnation. But Adriana will not accept the
      reproof: she will have her husband at all costs. The whole scene discovers
      personal feeling. Adriana is the portrait that Shakespeare wished to give
      us of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned commentators have seemingly conspired to say as little about
      &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; as possible. No one of them identifies the
      protagonist, Valentine, with Shakespeare, though all of them identified
      Biron with Shakespeare, and yet Valentine, as we shall see, is a far
      better portrait of the master than Biron. This untimely blindness of the
      critics is, evidently, due to the fact that Coleridge has hardly mentioned
      &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona,&rdquo; and they have consequently been unable to
      parrot his opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; is manifestly a later work than &ldquo;Love's
      Labour's Lost&rdquo;; there is more blank verse and less rhyme in it, and a
      considerable improvement in character-drawing. Julia, for example, is
      individualized and lives for us in her affection and jealousy; her talks
      with her maid Lucetta are taken from life; they are indeed the first
      sketch of the delightful talks between Portia and Nerissa, and mark an
      immense advance upon the wordy <i>badinage</i> of the Princess and her
      ladies in &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost,&rdquo; where there was no attempt at
      differentiation of character. It seems indubitable to me that &ldquo;The Two
      Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; is also later than &ldquo;The Comedy of Errors,&rdquo; and just
      as far beyond doubt that it is earlier than &ldquo;A Midsummer Night's Dream,&rdquo;
       in spite of Dr. Furnival's &ldquo;Trial Table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first three comedies, &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Comedy of Errors,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona,&rdquo; are all noteworthy for the light they
      throw on Shakespeare's early life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; Shakespeare makes similar youthful
      mistakes in portraiture to those we noticed in &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo;;
      mistakes which show that he is thinking of himself and his own
      circumstances. At the beginning of the play the only difference between
      Proteus and Valentine is that one is in love, and the other, heart-free,
      is leaving home to go to Milan. In this first scene Shakespeare speaks
      frankly through both Proteus and Valentine, just as he spoke through both
      the King and Biron in the first scene of &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost,&rdquo; and
      through both AEgeon and Antipholus of Syracuse in &ldquo;The Comedy of Errors.&rdquo;
       But whilst the circumstances in the earliest comedy are imaginary and
      fantastic, the circumstances in &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; are
      manifestly, I think, taken from the poet's own experience. In the dialogue
      between Valentine and Proteus I hear Shakespeare persuading himself that
      he should leave Stratford. Some readers may regard this assumption as
      far-fetched, but it will appear the more plausible, I think, the more the
      dialogue is studied. Valentine begins the argument:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits,&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      he will &ldquo;see the wonders of the world abroad&rdquo; rather than live &ldquo;dully
      sluggardiz'd at home,&rdquo; wearing out &ldquo;youth with shapeless idleness.&rdquo; But
      all these reasons are at once superfluous and peculiar. The audience needs
      no persuasion to believe that a young man is eager to travel and go to
      Court. Shakespeare's quick mounting spirit is in the lines, and the
      needlessness of the argument shows that we have here a personal
      confession. Valentine, then, mocks at love, because it was love that held
      Shakespeare so long in Stratford, and when Proteus defends it, he replies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Even so by Love the young and tender wit
  Is turned to folly; blasting in the bud,
  Losing his verdure even in the prime,
  And all the fair effects of future hopes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here is Shakespeare's confession that his marriage had been a failure, not
      only because of his wife's mad jealousy and violent temper, which we have
      been forced to realize in &ldquo;The Comedy of Errors,&rdquo; but also because love
      and its home-keeping ways threatened to dull and imprison the eager artist
      spirit. In the last charming line I find not only the music of
      Shakespeare's voice, but also one of the reasons&mdash;perhaps, indeed,
      the chief because the highest reason&mdash;which drew him from Stratford
      to London. And what the &ldquo;future hope&rdquo; was, he told us in the very first
      line of &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost.&rdquo; The King begins the play with&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Let Fame, that all hunt after in their lives.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Now all men don't hunt after fame; it was Shakespeare who felt that Fame
      pieced out Life's span and made us &ldquo;heirs of all eternity&rdquo;; it was young
      Shakespeare who desired fame so passionately that he believed all other
      men must share his immortal longing, the desire in him being a forecast of
      capacity, as, indeed, it usually is. If any one is inclined to think that
      I am here abusing conjecture let him remember that Proteus, too, tells us
      that Valentine is hunting after honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Proteus defends love we hear Shakespeare just as clearly as when
      Valentine inveighs against it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
  The eating canker dwells, so eating love
  Inhabits in the finest wits of all.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare could not be disloyal to that passion of desire in him which
      he instinctively felt was, in some way or other, the necessary complement
      of his splendid intelligence. We must take the summing-up of Proteus when
      Valentine leaves him as the other half of Shakespeare's personal
      confession:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;He after honour hunts, I after love:
  He leaves his friends to dignify them more;
  I leave myself, my friends, and all for love.
  Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,&mdash;
  Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
  War with good counsel, set the world at naught;
  Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Young Shakespeare hunted as much after love as after honour, and these
      verses show that he has fully understood what a drag on him his foolish
      marriage has been. That all this is true to Shakespeare appears from the
      fact that it is false to the character of Proteus. Proteus is supposed to
      talk like this in the first blush of passion, before he has won Julia,
      before he even knows that she loves him. Is that natural? Or is it not
      rather Shakespeare's confession of what two wasted years of married life
      in Stratford had done for him? It was ambition&mdash;desire of fame and
      new love&mdash;that drove the tired and discontented Shakespeare from Anne
      Hathaway's arms to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his father tells Proteus he must to Court on the morrow, instead of
      showing indignation or obstinate resolve to outwit tyranny, he generalizes
      in Shakespeare's way, exactly as Romeo and Orsino generalize in poetic
      numbers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, how this spring of love resembleth
  The uncertain glory of an April day.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Another reason for believing that this play deals with Shakespeare's own
      experiences is to be found in the curious change that takes place in
      Valentine. In the first act Valentine disdains love: he prefers to travel
      and win honour; but as soon as he reaches Milan and sees Silvia, he falls
      even more desperately in love than Proteus. What was the object, then, in
      making him talk so earnestly against love in the first act? It may be
      argued that Shakespeare intended merely to contrast the two characters in
      the first act; but he contrasts them in the first act on this matter of
      love, only in the second act to annul the distinction himself created.
      Moreover, and this is decisive, Valentine rails against love in the first
      act as one who has experienced love's utmost rage:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;To be
  In love: when scorn is bought with groans; coy looks,
  With heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth,
  With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The man who speaks like this is not the man who despises love and prefers
      honour, but one who has already given himself to passion with an absolute
      abandonment. Such inconsistencies and flaws in workmanship are in
      themselves trivial, but, from my point of view, significant; for whenever
      Shakespeare slips in drawing character, in nine cases out of ten he slips
      through dragging in his own personality or his personal experience, and
      not through carelessness, much less incompetence; his mistakes, therefore,
      nearly always throw light on his nature or on his life's story. From the
      beginning, too, Valentine like Shakespeare is a born lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon, moreover, as he has gone to the capital and fallen in love he
      becomes Shakespeare's avowed favourite. He finds Silvia's glove and cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      the exclamation reminding us of how Romeo talks of Juliet's glove. Like
      other men, Shakespeare learned life gradually, and in youth poverty of
      experience forces him to repeat his effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, when Valentine praises his friend Proteus to the Duke, we find a
      characteristic touch of Shakespeare. Valentine says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;His years but young; but his experience old;
  His head unmellowed; but his judgement ripe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice&rdquo; Bellario, the learned doctor of Padua, praises
      Portia in similar terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew so young a body with so old a head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it is when Valentine confesses his love that Shakespeare speaks
      through him most clearly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ay, Proteus, but that life is altered now,
  I have done penance for contemning love;
       - -       - -       - -       - -
  For in revenge of my contempt of love
  Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
  And made them watchers of my own heart's sorrow.
  O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every word in this confession is characteristic of the poet and especially
      the fact that his insomnia is due to love. Valentine then gives himself to
      passionate praise of Silvia, and ends with the &ldquo;She is alone&rdquo; that recalls
      &ldquo;She is all the beauty extant&rdquo; of &ldquo;The Two Noble Kinsmen.&rdquo; Valentine the
      lover reminds us of Romeo as the sketch resembles the finished picture;
      when banished, he cries:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not death, rather than living torment? To die is to be banished
      from myself; And Silvia is myself: banished from her, Is self from self; a
      deadly banishment. What light is light, if Silvia be not seen? What joy is
      joy, if Silvia be not by? Unless it be to think that she is by And feed
      upon the shadow of perfection. Except I be by Silvia in the night There is
      no music in the nightingale,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      and so forth. I might compare this with what Romeo says of his banishment,
      and perhaps infer from this two-fold treatment of the theme that
      Shakespeare left behind in Stratford some dark beauty who may have given
      Anne Hathaway good cause for jealous rage. It must not be forgotten here
      that Dryasdust tells us he was betrothed to another girl when Anne
      Hathaway's relations forced him to marry their kinswoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later and this lover Valentine uses the very words that we found
      so characteristic in the mouth of the lover Orsino in Twelfth Night&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O I have fed upon this woe already,
  And now excess of it will make me surfeit.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Valentine, indeed, shows us traits of nearly all Shakespeare's later
      lovers, and this seems to me interesting, because of course all the
      qualities were in the youth, which were later differenced into various
      characters. His advice to the Duke, who pretends to be in love, is far too
      ripe, too contemptuous-true, to suit the character of such a votary of
      fond desire as Valentine was; it is mellow with experience and
      man-of-the-world wisdom, and the last couplet of it distinctly
      fore-shadows Benedick:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
  Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
  That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man
  If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But this is only an involuntary <i>aperçu</i> of Valentine, as indeed
      Benedick is only an intellectual mood of Shakespeare. And here Valentine
      is contrasted with Proteus, who gives somewhat different advice to Thurio,
      and yet advice which is still more characteristic of Shakespeare than
      Valentine-Benedick's counsel. Proteus says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;You must lay lime to tangle her desires
  By wailful sonnets, whose composéd rhymes
  Should be full fraught with serviceable vows.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In this way the young poet sought to give expression to different views of
      life, and so realize the complexity of his own nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other traits of Valentine's character that do not necessarily belong
      to him as a lover are all characteristic traits of Shakespeare. When he is
      playing the banished robber-chief far from his love, this is how Valentine
      consoles himself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
  I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
  Here can I sit alone unseen of any,
  And to the nightingale's complaining notes
  Tune my distresses and record my woes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This idyllic love of nature, this marked preference for the country over
      the city, however peculiar in a highway robber, are characteristics of
      Shakespeare from youth to age. Not only do his comedies lead us
      continually from the haunts of men to the forest and stream, but also his
      tragedies. He turns to nature, indeed, in all times of stress and trouble
      for its healing unconsciousness, its gentle changes that can be foreseen
      and reckoned upon, and that yet bring fresh interests and charming
      surprises; and in times of health and happiness he pictures the pleasant
      earth and its diviner beauties with a passionate intensity. Again and
      again we shall have to notice his poet's love for &ldquo;unfrequented woods,&rdquo;
       his thinker's longing for &ldquo;the life removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the drama Valentine displays the gentle forgivingness of
      disposition which we have already had reason to regard as one of
      Shakespeare's most marked characteristics. As soon as &ldquo;false, fleeting
      Proteus&rdquo; confesses his sin Valentine pardons him with words that echo and
      re-echo through Shakespeare's later dramas:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                   &ldquo;Then I am paid,
  And once again I do receive thee honest.
  Who by repentance is not satisfied
  Is nor of heaven nor earth; for these are pleased;
  By patience the Eternal's wrath's appeased.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He even goes further than this, and confounds our knowledge of human
      nature by adding:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And that my love may appear plain and free
  All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And that the meaning may be made more distinct than words can make it, he
      causes Julia to faint on hearing the proposal. One cannot help recalling
      the passage in &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice&rdquo; when Bassanio and Gratiano both
      declare they would sacrifice their wives to free Antonio, and a well-known
      sonnet which seems to prove that Shakespeare thought more of a man's
      friendship for a man than of a man's love for a woman. But as I shall have
      to discuss this point at length when I handle the Sonnets, I have,
      perhaps, said enough for the moment. Nor need I consider the fact here
      that the whole of this last scene of the last act was manifestly revised
      or rewritten by Shakespeare <i>circa</i> 1598&mdash;years after the rest
      of the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think every one will admit now that Shakespeare revealed himself in &ldquo;The
      Two Gentlemen of Verona,&rdquo; and especially in Valentine, much more fully
      than in Biron and in &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo; The three earliest comedies
      prove that from the very beginning of his career Shakespeare's chief aim
      was to reveal and realize himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. SHAKESPEARE AS ANTONIO, THE MERCHANT
    </h2>
    <p>
      No one, so far as I know, has yet tried to identify Antonio, the Merchant
      of Venice, with Shakespeare, and yet Antonio is Shakespeare himself, and
      Shakespeare in what to us, children of an industrial civilization, is the
      most interesting attitude possible. Here in Antonio for the first time we
      discover Shakespeare in direct relations with real life, as real life is
      understood in the twentieth century. From Antonio we shall learn what
      Shakespeare thought of business men and business methods&mdash;of our
      modern way of living. Of course we must be on our guard against drawing
      general conclusions from this solitary example, unless we find from other
      plays that Antonio's attitude towards practical affairs was indeed
      Shakespeare's. But if this is the case, if Shakespeare has depicted
      himself characteristically in Antonio, how interesting it will be to hear
      his opinion of our money-making civilization. It will be as if he rose
      from the dead to tell us what he thinks of our doings. He has been
      represented by this critic and by that as a master of affairs, a prudent
      thrifty soul; now we shall see if this monstrous hybrid of tradesman-poet
      ever had any foundation in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first point to be settled is: Did Shakespeare reveal himself very
      ingenuously and completely in Antonio, or was the &ldquo;royal merchant&rdquo; a mere
      pose of his, a mood or a convention? Let us take Antonio's first words,
      the words, too, which begin the play:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
  It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
  But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
  What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
  I am to learn;
  And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
  That I have much ado to know myself.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is this very sadness that makes it easy for us to know Shakespeare,
      even when he disguises himself as a Venetian merchant. A little later and
      Jaques will describe and define the disease as &ldquo;humorous melancholy&rdquo;; but
      here it is already a settled habit of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonio then explains that his sadness has no cause, and incidentally
      attributes his wealth to fortune and not to his own brains or endeavour.
      The modern idea of the Captain of Industry who enriches others as well as
      himself, had evidently never entered into Shakespeare's head. Salarino
      says Antonio is &ldquo;sad to think upon his merchandise&rdquo;; but Antonio answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it.
  My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
  Nor to one place: nor is my whole estate
  Upon the fortune of this present year:
  Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This tone of modest gentle sincerity is Shakespeare's habitual tone from
      about his thirtieth year to the end of his life: it has the accent of
      unaffected nature. In bidding farewell to Salarino Antonio shows us the
      exquisite courtesy which Shakespeare used in life. Salarino, seeing
      Bassanio approaching, says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I would have stayed till I had made you merry,
  If worthier friends had not prevented me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Antonio answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Your worth is very dear in my regard.
  I take it, your own business calls on you,
  And you embrace the occasion to depart.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      More characteristic still is the dialogue between Gratiano and Antonio in
      the same scene. Gratiano, the twin-brother surely of Mercutio, tells
      Antonio that he thinks too much of the things of this world, and warns
      him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;They lose it that do buy it with much care.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Antonio replies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
  A stage, where every man must play a part,
  And mine a sad one.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Every one who has followed me so far will admit that this is Shakespeare's
      most usual and most ingenuous attitude towards life; &ldquo;I do not esteem
      worldly possessions,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;life itself is too transient, too unreal
      to be dearly held.&rdquo; Gratiano's reflection, too, is Shakespeare's, and puts
      the truth in a nutshell:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;They lose it that do buy it with much care.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      We now come to the most salient peculiarity in this play. When Bassanio,
      his debtor, asks him for more money, Antonio answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My purse, my person, my extremes! means,
  Lie all unlocked to your occasions.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And, though Bassanio tells him his money is to be risked on a romantic and
      wild adventure, Antonio declares that Bassanio's doubt does him more wrong
      than if his friend had already wasted all he has, and the act closes by
      Antonio pressing Bassanio to use his credit &ldquo;to the uttermost.&rdquo; Now, this
      contempt of money was, no doubt, a pose, if not a habit of the
      aristocratic society of the time, and Shakespeare may have been aping the
      tone of his betters in putting to show a most lavish generosity. But even
      if his social superiors encouraged him in a wasteful extravagance, it must
      be admitted that Shakespeare betters their teaching. The lord was
      riotously lavish, no doubt, because he had money, or could get it without
      much trouble; but, put in Antonio's position, he would not press his last
      penny on his friend, much less strain his credit &ldquo;to the uttermost&rdquo; for
      him as Antonio does for Bassanio. Here we have the personal note of
      Shakespeare: &ldquo;Your affection,&rdquo; says the elder man to the younger, &ldquo;is all
      to me, and money's less than nothing in the balance. Don't let us waste a
      word on it; a doubt of me were an injury!&rdquo; But men will do that for
      affection which they would never do in cool blood, and therefore one
      cannot help asking whether Shakespeare really felt and practised this
      extreme contempt of wealth? For the moment, if we leave his actions out of
      the account, there can be, I think, no doubt about his feelings. His
      dislike of money makes him disfigure reality. No merchant, it may fairly
      be said, either of the sixteenth century or the twentieth, ever amassed or
      kept a fortune with Antonio's principles. In our day of world-wide
      speculation and immense wealth it is just possible for a man to be a
      millionaire and generous; but in the sixteenth century, when wealth was
      made by penurious saving, by slow daily adding of coin to coin, merchants
      like this Antonio were unheard of, impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover all the amiable characters in this play regard money with
      unaffected disdain; Portia no sooner hears of Shylock's suit than she
      cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
  Double six thousand, and then treble that,
  Before a friend of this description
  Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And if we attribute this outburst to her love we must not forget that,
      when it comes to the test in court, and she holds the Jew in her hand and
      might save her gold, she again reminds him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Shylock, there's thrice thy money offered thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A boundless generosity is the characteristic of Portia, and Bassanio, the
      penniless fortune-hunter, is just as extravagant; he will pay the Jew's
      bond twice over, and,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;If that will not suffice,
  I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
  On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It may, of course, be urged that these Christians are all prodigal in
      order to throw Shylock's avarice and meanness into higher light; but that
      this disdain of money is not assumed for the sake of any artistic effect
      will appear from other plays. At the risk of being accused of
      super-subtlety, I must confess that I find in Shylock himself traces of
      Shakespeare's contempt of money; Jessica says of him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;I have heard him swear
  To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
  That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
  Than twenty times the value of the sum
  That he did owe him.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Even Shylock, it appears, hated Antonio more than he valued money, and
      this hatred, though it may have its root in love of money, half redeems
      him in our eyes. Shakespeare could not imagine a man who loved money more
      than anything else; his hated and hateful usurer is more a man of passion
      than a Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same prodigality and contempt of money are to be found in nearly all
      Shakespeare's plays, and, curiously enough, the persons to show this
      disdain most strongly are usually the masks of Shakespeare himself. A
      philosophic soliloquy is hardly more characteristic of Shakespeare than a
      sneer at money. It should be noted, too, that this peculiarity is not a
      trait of his youth chiefly, as it is with most men who are free-handed. It
      rather seems, as in the case of Antonio, to be a reasoned attitude towards
      life, and it undoubtedly becomes more and more marked as Shakespeare grows
      older. Contempt of wealth is stronger in Brutus than in Antonio; stronger
      in Lear than in Brutus, and stronger in Timon than in Lear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But can we be at all certain that Antonio's view of life in this respect
      was Shakespeare's? It may be that Shakespeare pretended to this generosity
      in order to loosen the purse-strings of his lordly patrons. Even if his
      motive for writing in this strain were a worthy motive, who is to assure
      us that he practised the generosity he preached? When I come to his life I
      think I shall be able to prove that Shakespeare was excessively careless
      of money; extravagant, indeed, and generous to a fault. Shakespeare did
      not win to eminence as a dramatist without exciting the envy and jealousy
      of many of his colleagues and contemporaries, and if these sharp-eyed
      critics had found him in drama after drama advocating lavish
      free-handedness while showing meanness or even ordinary prudence in his
      own expenditure, we should probably have heard of it as we heard from
      Greene how he took plays from other playwrights. But the silence of his
      contemporaries goes to confirm the positive testimony of Ben Jonson, that
      he was of &ldquo;an open and free nature,&rdquo;&mdash;openhanded always, and liberal,
      we may be sure, to a fault. In any case, the burden of proof lies with
      those who wish us to believe that Shakespeare was &ldquo;a careful and prudent
      man of business,&rdquo; for in a dozen plays the personages who are his heroes
      and incarnations pour contempt on those who would lock &ldquo;rascal counters&rdquo;
       from their friends, and, in default of proof to the contrary, we are
      compelled to assume that he practised the generosity which he so earnestly
      and sedulously praised. At least it will be advisable for the moment to
      assume that he pictured himself as generous Antonio, without difficulty or
      conscious self-deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this Antonio has not only the melancholy, courtesy and boundless
      generosity of Shakespeare; he has other qualities of the master which need
      to be thrown into relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, Antonio has that submission to misfortune, that resignation
      in face of defeat and suffering which we have already seen as
      characteristics of Richard II. The resignation might almost be called
      saintly, were it not that it seems to spring rather from the natural
      melancholy and sadness of Shakespeare's disposition; &ldquo;the world is a hard,
      all-hating world,&rdquo; he seems to say, &ldquo;and misery is the natural lot of man;
      defeat comes to all; why should I hope for any better fortune?&rdquo; At the
      very beginning of the trial he recognizes that he is certain to lose;
      Bassanio and Gratiano appeal to the Duke for him; but he never speaks in
      his own defence; he says of his opponent at the outset:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                        &ldquo;I do oppose
  My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
  To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
  The very tyranny and rage of his.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and again he will not contend, but begs the Court,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;.... with all brief and plain conveniency
  Let me have judgement and the Jew his will.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Even when Bassanio tries to cheer him,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    &ldquo;What, man, courage yet!
  The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
  Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Antonio answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am a tainted wether of the flock,
  Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
  Drops earliest to the ground: and so let me:
  You cannot better be employed, Bassanio,
  Than to live still and write mine epitaph.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He will not be saved: he gives himself at once to that &ldquo;sweet way of
      despair&rdquo; which we have found to be the second Richard's way and
      Shakespeare's way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as we noticed, when speaking of Posthumus in &ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo; that
      Shakespeare's hero and <i>alter ego</i> is always praised by the other
      personages of the drama, so this Antonio is praised preposterously by the
      chief personages of the play, and in the terms of praise we may see how
      Shakespeare, even in early manhood, liked to be considered. He had no
      ambition to be counted stalwart, or bold, or resolute like most young
      males of his race, much less &ldquo;a good hater,&rdquo; as Dr. Johnson confessed
      himself: he wanted his gentle qualities recognized, and his intellectual
      gifts; Hamlet wished to be thought a courtier, scholar, gentleman; and
      here Salarino says of Antonio:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A kinder gentleman treads not the earth,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and he goes on to tell how Antonio, when parting from Bassanio, had &ldquo;eyes
      big with tears&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
  And with affection wondrous sensible
  He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This Antonio is as tender-hearted and loving as young Arthur. And Lorenzo
      speaks of Antonio to Portia just as Salarino spoke of him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Lor</i>. But if you knew to whom you show this honour.
  How true a gentleman you send relief,
  How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
  I know you would be prouder of the work
  Than customary bounty can enforce you.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and finally Bassanio sums Antonio up in enthusiastic superlatives:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
  The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
  In doing courtesies, and one in whom
  The ancient Roman honour more appears
  Than any that draws breath in Italy.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is as a prince of friends and most courteous gentleman that Antonio
      acts his part from the beginning to the end of the play with one notable
      exception to which I shall return in a moment. It is astonishing to find
      this sadness, this courtesy, this lavish generosity and contempt of money,
      this love of love and friendship and affection in any man in early
      manhood; but these qualities were Shakespeare's from youth to old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say that Antonio was most courteous to all with one notable exception,
      and that exception was Shylock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has become the custom on the English stage for the actor to try to turn
      Shylock into a hero; but that was assuredly not Shakespeare's intention.
      True, he makes Shylock appeal to the common humanity of both Jew and
      Christian.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew
  hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?
  fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
  subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
  warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
  a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you
  tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not
  die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But if Shakespeare was far in advance of his age in this intellectual
      appreciation of the brotherhood of man; yet as an artist and thinker and
      poet he is particularly contemptuous of the usurer and trader in other
      men's necessities, and therefore, when Antonio meets Shylock, though he
      wants a favour from him, he cannot be even decently polite to him. He
      begins by saying in the third scene of the first act:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Although I neither lend nor borrow
  By taking nor by giving of excess,
  Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
  I'll break a custom.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The first phrase here reminds me of Polonius: &ldquo;neither a borrower nor a
      lender be.&rdquo; When Shylock attempts to defend himself by citing the way
      Jacob cheated Laban, Antonio answers contemptuously &ldquo;The devil can cite
      Scripture for his purpose.&rdquo; Shylock then goes on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Signor Antonio, many a time and oft,
  In the Rialto you have rated me
  About my moneys and my usances:
  Still, I have borne it with a patient shrug,
  For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
  You call me mis-believer, cut-throat dog,
  And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
  And all for use of that which is mine own.
  Well then, it now appears you need my help:
  Go to, then; you come to me, and you say,
  'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so
  You that did void your rheum upon my beard
  And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
  Over your threshold: moneys is your suit.
  What should I say to you? Should I not say
  'Hath a dog money? is it possible
  A cur can lend three thousand ducats?'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Antonio answers this in words which it would be almost impossible to take
      for Shakespeare's because of their brutal rudeness, were it not, as we
      shall see later, that Shakespeare loathed the Jew usurer more than any
      character in all his plays. Here are the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Ant</i>. I am as like to call thee so again,
  To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
  If thou will lend this money, lend it not
  As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
  A breed for barren metal of his friend?
  But lend it rather to thine enemy
  Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
  Exact the penalty.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then Shylock makes peace, and proposes his modest penalty. Bassanio says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
  I'll rather dwell in my necessity.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Antonio is perfectly careless and content: he says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond,
  And say there is much kindness in the Jew.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Antonio's heedless trust of other men and impatience are qualities most
      foreign to the merchant; but are shown again and again by Shakespeare's
      impersonations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it will be well here to prove once for all that Shakespeare did
      really hate the Jew. In the first place he excites our sympathy again and
      again for him on the broad grounds of common humanity; but the moment it
      comes to a particular occasion he represents him as hateful, even where a
      little thought would have taught him that the Jew must be at his best. It
      is a peculiarity of humanity which Shakespeare should not have overlooked,
      that all pariahs and outcasts display intense family affection; those whom
      the world scouts and hates are generally at their noblest in their own
      homes. The pressure from the outside, Herbert Spencer would say, tends to
      bring about cohesion among the members of the despised caste. The family
      affection of the Jew, his kindness to his kindred, have become proverbial.
      But Shakespeare admits no such kindness in Shylock: when his daughter
      leaves Shylock one would think that Shakespeare would picture the father's
      desolation and misery, his sorrow at losing his only child; but here there
      is no touch of sympathy in gentle Shakespeare:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;.... I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in
   her ear! would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her
   coffin!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But there is even better proof than this: when Shylock is defeated in his
      case and leaves the Court penniless and broken, Shakespeare allows him to
      be insulted by a gentleman. Shylock becomes pathetic in his defeat, for
      Shakespeare always sympathized with failure, even before he came to grief
      himself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Shy</i>. Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
  You take my house when you do take the prop
  That doth sustain my house; you take my life
  When you do take the means whereby I live.&rdquo;

  &ldquo;<i>Por</i>. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

  <i>Gra</i>. A halter gratis; nothing else for God's sake.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then Antonio offers to &ldquo;quit the fine for one-half his goods.&rdquo; Utterly
      broken now, Shylock says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
  I am not well: send the deed after me,
  And I will sign it.

  <i>Duke</i>. Get thee gone, but do it.

  <i>Gra</i>. In christening shalt thou have two godfathers:
  Had I been judge, thou should'st have had ten more,
  To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A brutal insult from a gallant gentleman to the broken Jew: it is the only
      time in all Shakespeare when a beaten and ruined man is so insulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonio, it must be confessed, is a very charming sketch of Shakespeare
      when he was about thirty years of age, and it is amusing to reflect that
      it is just the rich merchant with all his wealth at hazard whom he picks
      out to embody his utter contempt of riches. The &ldquo;royal merchant,&rdquo; as he
      calls him, trained from youth to barter, is the very last man in the world
      to back such a venture as Bassanio's&mdash;much less would such a man
      treat money with disdain. But Shakespeare from the beginning of the play
      put himself quite naively in Antonio's place, and so the astounding
      antinomy came to expression.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE SONNETS: PART I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ever since Wordsworth wrote that the sonnets were the key to Shakespeare's
      heart, it has been taken for granted (save by those who regard even the
      sonnets as mere poetical exercises) that Shakespeare's real nature is
      discovered in the sonnets more easily and more surely than in the plays.
      Those readers who have followed me so far in examining his plays will
      hardly need to be told that I do not agree with this assumption. The
      author whose personality is rich and complex enough to create and vitalize
      a dozen characters, reveals himself more fully in his creations than he
      can in his proper person. It was natural enough that Wordsworth, a great
      lyric poet, should catch Shakespeare's accent better in his sonnets than
      in his dramas; but that is owing to Wordsworth's limitations. And if the
      majority of later English critics have agreed with Wordsworth, it only
      shows that Englishmen in general are better judges of lyric than of
      dramatic work. We have the greatest lyrics in the world; but our dramas,
      with the exception of Shakespeare's, are not remarkable. And in that
      modern extension of the drama, the novel, we are distinctly inferior to
      the French and Russians. This inferiority must be ascribed to the
      new-fangled prudery of language and thought which emasculates all our
      later fiction; but as that prudery is not found in our lyric verse it is
      evident that here alone the inspiration is full and rich enough to
      overflow the limits of epicene convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the reader agrees with me or not on this point, it may be accepted
      that Shakespeare revealed himself far more completely in his plays than as
      a lyric poet. Just as he chose his dramatic subjects with some felicity to
      reveal his many-sided nature, so he used the sonnets with equal artistry
      to discover that part of himself which could hardly be rendered
      objectively. Whatever is masculine in a man can be depicted superbly on
      the stage, but his feminine qualities&mdash;passionate self-abandonment,
      facile forgivingness, self-pity&mdash;do not show well in the dramatic
      struggle. What sort of a drama would that be in which the hero would have
      to confess that when in the vale of years he had fallen desperately in
      love with a girl, and that he had been foolish enough to send a friend, a
      young noble, to plead his cause, with the result that the girl won the
      friend and gave herself to him? The protagonist would earn mocking
      laughter and not sympathy, and this Shakespeare no doubt foresaw. Besides,
      to Shakespeare, this story, which is in brief the story of the sonnets,
      was terribly real and intimate, and he felt instinctively that he could
      not treat it objectively; it was too near him, too exquisitely painful for
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some time or other life overpowers the strongest of us, and that defeat
      we all treat lyrically; when the deepest depth in us is stirred we cannot
      feign, or depict ourselves from the outside dispassionately; we can only
      cry our passion, our pain and our despair; this once we use no art, simple
      truth is all we seek to reach. The crisis of Shakespeare's life, the hour
      of agony and bloody sweat when his weakness found him out and life's
      handicap proved too heavy even for his strength&mdash;that is the subject
      of the sonnets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what was Shakespeare's weakness? his besetting temptation? &ldquo;Love is my
      sin,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;Love of love and her soft hours&rdquo; was his weakness: passion
      the snare that meshed his soul. No wonder Antony cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Whither hast thou led me, Egypt?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      for his gipsy led Shakespeare from shame to shame, to the verge of
      madness. The sonnets give us the story, the whole terrible, sinful,
      magical story of Shakespeare's passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As might have been expected, Englishmen like Wordsworth, with an intense
      appreciation of lyric poetry, have done good work in criticism of the
      sonnets, and one Englishman has read them with extraordinary
      understanding. Mr. Tyler's work on the sonnets ranks higher than that of
      Coleridge on the plays. I do not mean to say that it is on the same
      intellectual level with the work of Coleridge, though it shows wide
      reading, astonishing acuteness, and much skill in the marshalling of
      argument. But Mr. Tyler had the good fortune to be the first to give to
      the personages of the sonnets a local habitation and a name, and that
      unique achievement puts him in a place by himself far above the mass of
      commentators. Before his book appeared in 1890 the sonnets lay in the dim
      light of guess-work. It is true that Hallam had adopted the hypothesis of
      Boaden and Bright, and had identified William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke,
      with the high-born, handsome youth for whom Shakespeare, in the sonnets,
      expressed such passionate affection; but still, there were people who
      thought that the Earl of Southampton filled the requirements even better
      than William Herbert, and as I say, the whole subject lay in the twilight
      of surmise and supposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tyler, working on a hint of the Rev. W. A. Harrison, identified
      Shakespeare's high-born mistress, the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; of the sonnets, with
      Mistress Mary Fitton, a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      These, then, are the personages of the drama, and the story is very
      simple: Shakespeare loved Mistress Fitton and sent his friend, the young
      Lord Herbert, to her on some pretext, but with the design that he should
      commend Shakespeare to the lady. Mistress Fitton fell in love with William
      Herbert, wooed and won him, and Shakespeare had to mourn the loss of both
      friend and mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be natural to speak of this identification of Mr. Tyler's as the
      best working hypothesis yet put forward; but it would be unfair to him; it
      is more than this. Till his book appeared, even the date of the sonnets
      was not fixed; many critics regarded them as an early work, as early
      indeed, as 1591 or 1592; he was the first person to prove that the time
      they cover extends roughly from 1598 to 1601. Mr. Tyler then has not only
      given us the names of the actors, but he has put the tragedy in its proper
      place in Shakespeare's life, and he deserves all thanks for his
      illuminating work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bring to this theory fresh corroboration from the plays. Strange to say,
      Mr. Tyler has hardly used the plays, yet, as regards the story told in the
      sonnets, the proof that it is a real and not an imaginary story can be
      drawn from the plays. I may have to point out, incidentally, what I regard
      as mistakes and oversights in Mr. Tyler's work; but in the main it stands
      four-square, imposing itself on the reason and satisfying at the same time
      instinct and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us first see how far the story told in the sonnets is borne out by the
      plays. For a great many critics, even to-day, reject the story altogether,
      and believe that the sonnets were nothing but poetic exercises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sonnets fall naturally into two parts: from 1 to 126 they tell how
      Shakespeare loved a youth of high rank and great personal beauty; sonnet
      127 is an <i>envoi</i>; from 128 to 152 they tell of Shakespeare's love
      for a &ldquo;dark lady.&rdquo; What binds the two series together is the story told in
      both, or at least told in one and corroborated in the other, that
      Shakespeare first sent his friend to the lady, most probably to plead his
      cause, and that she wooed his friend and gave herself to him. Now this is
      not a common or easily invented story. No one would guess that Shakespeare
      could be so foolish as to send his friend to plead his love for him.
      That's a mistake that no man who knows women would be likely to make: but
      the unlikelihood of the story is part of the evidence of its truth&mdash;<i>credo
      quia incredibile</i> has an element of persuasion in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one has yet noticed that the story of the sonnets is treated three
      times in Shakespeare's plays. The first time the story appears it is
      handled so lightly that it looks to me as if he had not then lived through
      the incidents which he narrates. In the &ldquo;Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; Proteus
      is asked by the Duke to plead Thurio's cause with Silvia, and he promises
      to do so; but instead, presses his own suit and is rejected. The incident
      is handled so carelessly (Proteus not being Thurio's friend) that it seems
      to me to have no importance save as a mere coincidence. When the scene
      between Proteus and Silvia was written Shakespeare had not yet been
      deceived by his friend. Still in &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; there is
      one speech which certainly betrays personal passion. It is in the last
      scene of the fifth act, when Valentine surprises Proteus offering violence
      to Silvia.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Val.(coming forward)</i> Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil
                touch,&mdash;
  Thou friend of an ill fashion!

  <i>Pro</i>.         Valentine!

  <i>Val. Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,&mdash;
  For such is a friend now;</i>&mdash;treacherous man!
  Thou hast beguiled my hopes: nought but mine eye
  Could have persuaded me. Now I dare not say
  I have one friend alive: thou would'st disprove me.
  Who should be trusted when one's own right hand
  Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
  I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
  But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
  <i>The private wound is deepest: time most accurst
  'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!</i>&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The first lines which I have italicised are too plain to be misread; when
      they were written Shakespeare had just been cheated by his friend; they
      are his passionate comment on the occurrence&mdash;&ldquo;For such is a friend
      now&rdquo;&mdash;can hardly be otherwise explained. The last couplet, too, which
      I have also put in italics, is manifestly a reflection on his betrayal: it
      is a twin rendering of the feeling expressed in sonnet 40:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And yet love knows it is a greater grief
  To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It contrasts &ldquo;foe and friend,&rdquo; just as the sonnet contrasts &ldquo;love and
      hate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Israel Gollancz declares that &ldquo;several critics are inclined to
      attribute this final scene to another hand,&rdquo; and to his mind &ldquo;it bears
      evident signs of hasty composition.&rdquo; No guess could be wider from the
      truth. The scene is most manifestly pure Shakespeare&mdash;I take the
      soliloquy of Valentine, with which the scene opens, as among Shakespeare's
      most characteristic utterances&mdash;but the whole scene is certainly
      later than the rest of the play. The truth probably is that after his
      friend had deceived him, &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; was played again,
      and that Shakespeare rewrote this last scene under the influence of
      personal feeling. The 170 lines of it are full of phrases which might be
      taken direct from the sonnets. Here 's such a couplet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
  When women cannot love where they're beloved.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The whole scene tells the story a little more frankly than we find it in
      the sonnets, as might be expected, seeing that Shakespeare's rival was a
      great noble and not to be criticised freely. This fact explains to me
      Valentine's unmotived renunciation of Silvia; explains, too, why he is
      reconciled to his friend with such unseemly haste. Valentine's last words
      in the scene are illuminating:
    </p>

  &ldquo;'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The way this scene in &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; is told throws more
      light on Shakespeare's feelings at the moment of his betrayal than the
      sonnets themselves. Under the cover of fictitious names Shakespeare
      ventured to show the disgust and contempt he felt for Lord Herbert's
      betrayal more plainly than he cared, or perhaps dared, to do when speaking
      in his own person.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another play where the same incident is handled in such fashion
      as to put the truth of the sonnet-story beyond all doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;Much Ado about Nothing&rdquo; the incident is dragged in by the ears, and
      the whole treatment is most remarkable. Every one will remember how
      Claudio tells the Prince that he loves Hero, and asks his friend's
      assistance: &ldquo;your highness now may do me good.&rdquo; There's no reason for
      Claudio's shyness: no reason why he should call upon the Prince for help
      in a case where most men prefer to use their own tongues; but Claudio is
      young, and so we glide over the inherent improbability of the incident.
      The Prince at once promises to plead for Claudio with Hero and with her
      father:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
  That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Now comes the peculiar handling of the incident. Claudio knows the Prince
      is wooing Hero for him, therefore when Don John tells him that the Prince
      &ldquo;is enamoured on Hero,&rdquo; he should at once infer that Don John is mistaken
      through ignorance of this fact; but instead of that he falls suspicious,
      and questions:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;How know you he loves her?

  <i>D. John</i>. I heard him swear his affection.

  <i>Bor</i>. So did I too, and he swore he would marry her
  to-night.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There is absolutely nothing even in this corroboration by Borachio to
      shake Claudio's trust in the Prince: neither Don John nor Borachio knows
      what he knows, that the Prince is wooing for him (Claudio) and at his
      request. He should therefore smile at the futile attempt to excite his
      jealousy. But at once he is persuaded of the worst, as a man would be who
      had already experienced such disloyalty: he cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;'Tis certain so; the prince woos for himself.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then we should expect to hear him curse the prince as a traitorous
      friend, and dwell on his own loyal service by way of contrast, and so keep
      turning the dagger in the wound with the thought that no one but himself
      was ever so repaid for such honesty of love. But, no! Claudio has no
      bitterness in him, no reproachings; he speaks of the whole matter as if it
      had happened months and months before, as indeed it had; for &ldquo;Much Ado
      about Nothing&rdquo; was written about 1599. Reflection had already shown
      Shakespeare the unreason of revolt, and he puts his own thought in the
      mouth of Claudio:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;'Tis certain so; the prince woos for himself.
  Friendship is constant in all other things
  Save in the office and affairs of love:
  Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues;
  Let every eye negotiate for itself,
  And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch,
  Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
  <i>This is an accident of hourly proof,
  Which I mistrusted not</i>. Farewell, therefore, Hero.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Claudio who spoke like this in the first madness of love lost and
      friendship cheated would be a monster. Here we have Shakespeare speaking
      in all calmness of something that happened to himself a considerable time
      before. The lines I have put in italics admit no other interpretation:
      they show Shakespeare's philosophic acceptance of things as they are; what
      has happened to him is not to be assumed as singular but is the common lot
      of man&mdash;&ldquo;an accident of hourly proof&rdquo;&mdash;which he blames himself
      for not foreseeing. In fact, Claudio's temper here is as detached and
      impartial as Benedick's. Benedick declares that Claudio should be whipped:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>D. Pedro</i>. To be whipped! What's his fault?

  <i>Benedick</i>. The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who
  being overjoyed with finding a bird's nest, shows it his
  companion and he steals it.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      That is the view of the realist who knows life and men, and plays the game
      according to the rules accepted. Shakespeare understood this side of life
      as well as most men. But Don Pedro is a prince&mdash;a Shakespearean
      prince at that&mdash;full of all loyalties and ideal sentiments; he
      answers Benedick from Shakespeare's own heart:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Wilt thou make a trust a transgression?
  The transgression is in the stealer.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is curious that Shakespeare doesn't see that Claudio must feel this
      truth a thousand times more keenly than the Prince. As I have said,
      Claudio's calm acceptance of the fact is a revelation of Shakespeare's own
      attitude, an attitude just modified by the moral reprobation put in the
      mouth of the Prince. The recital itself shows that the incident was a
      personal experience of Shakespeare, and as one might expect in this case
      it does not accelerate but retard the action of the drama; it is, indeed,
      altogether foreign to the drama, an excrescence upon it and not an
      improvement but a blemish. Moreover, the reflective, disillusioned,
      slightly pessimistic tone of the narrative is alien and strange to the
      optimistic temper of the play; finally, this garb of patient sadness does
      not suit Claudio, who should be all love and eagerness, and diminishes
      instead of increasing our sympathy with his later actions. Whoever
      considers these facts will admit that we have here Shakespeare telling us
      what happened to himself, and what he really thought of his friend's
      betrayal.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The transgression is in the stealer.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      That is Shakespeare's mature judgement of Lord Herbert's betrayal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third mention of this sonnet-story in a play is later still: it is in
      &ldquo;Twelfth Night.&rdquo; The Duke, as we have seen, is an incarnation of
      Shakespeare himself, and, indeed, the finest incarnation we have of his
      temperament. In the fourth scene of the first act he sends Viola to plead
      his cause for him with Olivia, much in the same way, no doubt, as
      Shakespeare sent Pembroke to Miss Fitton. The whole scene deserves careful
      reading.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                   &ldquo;Cesario,
  Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
  To thee the book even of my secret soul:
  Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her
  Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
  And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
  Till thou have audience.

  <i>Vio</i>.        Sure, my noble lord,
  If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
  As it is spoke, she never will admit me.

  <i>Duke</i>. Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
  Rather than make unprofited return.

  <i>Vio</i>. Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?

  <i>Duke</i>. O, then unfold the passion of my love,
  Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
  It shall become thee well to act my woes;
  <i>She will attend it better in thy youth
  Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.</i>

  <i>Vio</i>. I think not so, my lord.

  <i>Duke</i>.                     Dear lad, believe it;
  For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
  That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
  Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
  Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound;
  And all is semblative a woman's part.
  I know thy constellation is right apt
  For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
  All if you will; for I myself am best
  When least in company.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I do not want to find more here than is in the text: the passage simply
      shows that this idea of sending some one to plead his love was constantly
      in Shakespeare's mind in these years. The curious part of the matter is
      that he should pick a youth as ambassador, and a youth who is merely his
      page. He can discover no reason for choosing such a boy as Viola, and so
      simply asserts that youth will be better attended to, which is certainly
      not the fact. Lord Herbert's youth was in his mind: but he could not put
      the truth in the play that when he chose his ambassador he chose him for
      his high position and personal beauty and charm, and not because of his
      youth. The whole incident is treated lightly as something of small import;
      the bitterness in &ldquo;Much Ado&rdquo; has died out: &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; was written
      about 1601, a year or so later than &ldquo;Much Ado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not want to labour the conclusion I have reached; but it must be
      admitted that I have found in the plays, and especially in &ldquo;The Two
      Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; and &ldquo;Much Ado,&rdquo; the same story which is told in the
      sonnets; a story lugged into the plays, where, indeed, its introduction is
      a grave fault in art and its treatment too peculiar to be anything but
      personal. Here in the plays we have, so to speak, three views of the
      sonnet-story; the first in &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona,&rdquo; when the
      betrayal is fresh in Shakespeare's memory and his words are embittered
      with angry feeling:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thou common friend that's without faith or love.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The second view is taken in &ldquo;Much Ado About Nothing&rdquo; when the pain of the
      betrayal has been a little salved by time. Shakespeare now moralizes the
      occurrence. He shows us how it would be looked upon by a philosopher (for
      that is what the lover, Claudio, is in regard to his betrayal) and by a
      soldier and man of the world, Benedick, and by a Prince. Shakespeare
      selects the prince to give effect to the view that the fault is in the
      transgressor and not in the man who trusts. The many-sided treatment of
      the story shows all the stages through which Shakespeare's mind moved, and
      the result is to me a more complete confession than is to be found in the
      sonnets. Finally the story is touched upon in &ldquo;Twelfth Night,&rdquo; when the
      betrayal has faded into oblivion, but the poet lets out the fact that his
      ambassador was a youth, and the reason he gives for this is plainly
      insufficient. If after these three recitals any one can still believe that
      the sonnet-story is imaginary, he is beyond persuasion by argument.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE SONNETS: PART II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now that we have found the story of the sonnets repeated three times in
      the plays, it may be worth our while to see if we can discover in the
      plays anything that throws light upon the circumstances or personages of
      this curious triangular drama. At the outset, I must admit that save in
      these three plays I can find no mention whatever of Shakespeare's
      betrayer, Lord Herbert. He was &ldquo;a false friend,&rdquo; the plays tell us, a
      &ldquo;common friend without faith or love,&rdquo; &ldquo;a friend of an ill fashion&rdquo;;
      young, too, yet trusted; but beyond this summary superficial
      characterization there is silence. <i>Me judice</i> Lord Herbert made no
      deep or peculiar impression on Shakespeare; an opinion calculated to give
      pause to the scandal-mongers. For there can be no doubt whatever that
      Shakespeare's love, Mistress Fitton, the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; of the sonnet-series
      from 128 to 152 is to be found again and again in play after play,
      profoundly modifying the poet's outlook upon life and art. Before I take
      in hand this identification of Miss Fitton and her influence upon
      Shakespeare, let me beg the reader to bear in mind the fact that
      Shakespeare was a sensualist by nature, a lover, which is as rare a thing
      as consummate genius. The story of his idolatrous passion for Mary Fitton
      is the story of his life. This is what the commentators and critics
      hitherto have failed to appreciate. Let us now get at the facts and see
      what light the dramas throw upon the chief personage of the story,
      Mistress Fitton. The study will probably teach us that Shakespeare was the
      most impassioned lover and love-poet in all literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      History tells us that Mary Fitton became a maid of honour to Queen
      Elizabeth in 1595 at the age of seventeen. From a letter addressed by her
      father to Sir Robert Cecil on January 29th, 1599, it is fairly certain
      that she had already been married at the age of sixteen; the union was
      probably not entirely valid, but the mere fact suggests a certain
      recklessness of character, or overpowering sensuality, or both, and shows
      that even as a girl Mistress Fitton was no shrinking, timid, modest
      maiden. Wrapped in a horseman's cloak she used to leave the Palace at
      night to meet her lover, Lord William Herbert. Though twice married, she
      had an illegitimate child by Herbert, and two later by Sir Richard
      Leveson.
    </p>
    <p>
      This extraordinary woman is undoubtedly the sort of woman Shakespeare
      depicted as the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; of the sonnets. Nearly every sonnet of the
      twenty-six devoted to his mistress contains some accusation against her;
      and all these charges are manifestly directed against one and the same
      woman. First of all she is described in sonnet 131 as &ldquo;tyrannous&rdquo;; then in
      sonnet 133 as &ldquo;faithless&rdquo;; in sonnet 137 as &ldquo;the bay where all men ride
      ... the wide world's commonplace&rdquo;; in sonnet 138 as &ldquo;false&rdquo;; in 139, she
      is &ldquo;coquettish&rdquo;; 140, &ldquo;proud&rdquo;; &ldquo;false to the bonds of love&rdquo;; &ldquo;black as
      hell... dark as night&rdquo;&mdash;in both looks and character; &ldquo;full of foul
      faults &ldquo;; &ldquo;cruel&rdquo;; &ldquo;unworthy,&rdquo; but of &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; personality; &ldquo;unkind&mdash;inconstant...
      unfaithful... forsworn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, the first question is: Can we find this &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; of the sonnets in
      the plays? The sonnets tell us she was of pale complexion with black eyes
      and hair; do the plays bear out this description? And if they do bear it
      out do they throw any new light upon Miss Fitton's character? Did Miss
      Fitton seem proud and inconstant, tyrannous and wanton, to Shakespeare
      when he first met her, and before she knew Lord Herbert?
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest mention of the poet's mistress in the plays is to be found, I
      think, in &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; is dated by Mr. Furnival
      1591-1593; it was first mentioned in 1595 by Meres; first published in
      1597. I think in its present form it must be taken to date from 1597.
      Romeo, who as we have already seen, is an incarnation of Shakespeare, is
      presented to us in the very first scene as in love with one Rosaline. This
      in itself tells me nothing; but the proof that Shakespeare stands in
      intimate relation to the girl called Rosaline comes later, and so the
      first introductory words have a certain significance for me. Romeo himself
      tells us that &ldquo;she hath Dian's wit,&rdquo; one of Shakespeare's favourite
      comparisons for his love, and speaks of her chastity, or rather of her
      unapproachableness; he goes on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O she is rich in beauty, only poor
  That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      which reminds us curiously of the first sonnets. In the second scene
      Benvolio invites Romeo to the feast of Capulet, where his love, &ldquo;the fair
      Rosaline,&rdquo; is supping, and adds:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Compare her face with some that I shall shew,
  And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Romeo replies that there is none fairer than his love, and Benvolio
      retorts:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Tut! You saw her fair, none else being by.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This bantering is most pointed if we assume that Rosaline was dark rather
      than fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second act Mercutio comes upon the scene, and, mocking Romeo's
      melancholy and passion, cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I conjure thee, by Rosaline's bright eyes,
  By her high forehead and her scarlet lip....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This description surprises me. Shakespeare rarely uses such physical
      portraiture of his personages, and Mercutio is a side of Shakespeare
      himself; a character all compact of wit and talkativeness, a character
      wholly invented by the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later my suspicion is confirmed. In the fourth scene of the
      second act Mercutio talks to Benvolio about Romeo; they both wonder where
      he is, and Mercutio says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ah, that same pale-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
  Torments him so that he will sure run mad.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And again, a moment later, Mercutio laughs at Romeo as already dead,
      &ldquo;stabbed with a white wench's black eye.&rdquo; Now, here is confirmation of my
      suspicion. It is most unusual for Shakespeare to give the physical
      peculiarities of any of his characters; no one knows how Romeo looked, or
      Juliet or even Hamlet or Ophelia; and here he repeats the description.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other examples we have as yet found in Shakespeare of such
      physical portraiture is the sketching of Falstaff in &ldquo;Henry IV.&rdquo; and the
      snapshot of Master Slender in &ldquo;The Merry Wives of Windsor,&rdquo; as a &ldquo;little
      wee face, with a little yellow beard,&mdash;a cane-coloured beard.&rdquo; Both
      these photographs, as we noticed at the time, were very significant, and
      Slender's extraordinarily significant by reason of its striking and
      peculiar realism. Though an insignificant character, Slender is
      photographed for us by Shakespeare's contempt and hatred, just as this
      Rosaline is photographed by his passionate love, photographed again and
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's usual way of describing the physical appearance of a man or
      woman, when he allowed himself to do it at all, which was seldom, was what
      one might call the ideal or conventional way. A good example is to be
      found in Hamlet's description of his father; he is speaking to his mother:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself,
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,
  A station like the herald Mercury
    New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the special case I am considering Rosaline is less even than a
      secondary character; she is not a personage in the play at all. She is
      merely mentioned casually by Benvolio and then by Mercutio, and even
      Mercutio is not the protagonist; yet his mention of her is strikingly
      detailed, astonishingly realistic, in spite of its off-hand brevity. We
      have a photographic snapshot, so to speak, of this girl: she &ldquo;torments&rdquo;
       Romeo; she is &ldquo;hard-hearted&rdquo;; a &ldquo;white wench&rdquo; with &ldquo;black eyes&rdquo;; twice in
      four lines she is called now &ldquo;pale,&rdquo; now &ldquo;white&rdquo;&mdash;plainly her
      complexion had no red in it, and was in startling contrast to her black
      eyes and hair. Manifestly this picture is taken from life, and it is just
      as manifestly the portrait of the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; of the sonnets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to make assurance doubly sure, there is another description of this
      same Rosaline in another play, so detailed and striking, composed as it is
      of contrasting and startling peculiarities that I can only wonder that its
      full significance has not been appreciated ages ago. To have missed its
      meaning only proves that men do not read Shakespeare with love's fine wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repetition of the portrait is fortunate for another reason: it tells
      us when the love story took place. The allusion to the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; in
      &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; is difficult to date exactly; the next mention of her
      in a play can be fixed in time with some precision. &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo;
       was revised by Shakespeare for production at Court during the Christmas
      festivities of 1597. When the quarto was published in 1598 it bore on its
      title-page the words, &ldquo;A pleasant conceited comedy called 'Love's Labour's
      Lost.' As it was presented before Her Highnes this last Christmas. Newly
      corrected and augmented By W. Shakespeare.&rdquo; It is in the revised part that
      we find Shakespeare introducing his dark love again, and this time, too,
      curiously enough, under the name of Rosaline. Evidently he enjoyed the
      mere music of the word. Biron is an incarnation of Shakespeare himself, as
      we have already seen, and the meeting of Biron and his love, Rosaline, in
      the play is extremely interesting for us as Shakespeare in this revised
      production, one would think, would wish to ingratiate himself with his
      love, more especially as she would probably be present when the play was
      produced. Rosaline is made to praise Biron, before he appears, as a merry
      man and a most excellent talker; but when they meet they simply indulge in
      a tourney of wit, in which Rosaline more than holds her own, showing
      indeed astounding self-assurance, spiced with a little contempt of Biron;
      &ldquo;hard-hearted&rdquo; Mercutio called it. Every word deserves to be weighed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Biron</i>. Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

  <i>Ros</i>. Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

  <i>Biron</i>. I know you did.

  <i>Ros</i>. How needless was it, then, to ask the question!

  <i>Biron</i>. You must not be so quick.

  <i>Ros</i>. 'Tis long of you that spur me with such questions.

  <i>Biron</i>. Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

  <i>Ros</i>. Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

  <i>Biron</i>. What time o' day?

  <i>Ros</i>. The hour that fools should ask.

  <i>Biron</i>. Now fair befall your mask!

  <i>Ros</i>. Fair fall the face it covers!

  <i>Biron</i>. And send you many lovers!

  <i>Ros</i>. Amen, so you be none.

  <i>Biron</i>. Nay, then will I be gone.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Clearly this Rosaline, too, has Dian's wit and is not in love with Biron,
      any more than the Rosaline of &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; was in love with Romeo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next allusion is even more characteristic. Biron and Longaville and
      Boyet are talking; Longaville shows his admiration for one of the
      Princess's women, &ldquo;the one in the white&rdquo; he declares, is a most sweet
      lady....&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  <i>Biron</i>. What is her name in the cap?

  <i>Boyet</i>. Rosaline, by good hap.

  <i>Biron</i>. Is she wedded or no?

  <i>Boyet</i>. To her will, sir, or so.

  <i>Biron</i>. You are welcome, sir: adieu.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This, &ldquo;To her will, sir, or so,&rdquo; is exactly in the spirit of the sonnets:
      every one will remember the first two lines of sonnet 135:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy <i>Will</i>, And <i>Will</i> to
      boot, and <i>Will</i> in overplus;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That, &ldquo;To her will, sir, or so,&rdquo; I find astonishingly significant, for not
      only has it nothing to do with the play and is therefore unexpected, but
      the character-drawing is unexpected, too; maids are not usually wedded to
      their will in a double sense, and no other of these maids of honour is
      described at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later Biron speaks again of Rosaline in a way which shocks
      expectation. First of all, he rages at himself for being in love at all.
      &ldquo;And I, forsooth in love! I, that have been love's whip!&rdquo; Here I pause
      again, it seems to me that Shakespeare is making confession to us, just as
      when he admitted without reason that Jaques was lewd. Be that as it may,
      he certainly goes on in words which are astounding, so utterly unforeseen
      are they, and therefore the more characteristic:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
  And, among three, to love the worst of all;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The first line of this couplet, that he is perjured in loving Rosaline may
      be taken as applying to the circumstances of the play; but Shakespeare
      also talks of himself in sonnet 152 as &ldquo;perjured,&rdquo; for he only swears in
      order to misuse his love, or with a side glance at the fact that he is
      married and therefore perjured when he swears love to one not his wife. It
      is well to keep this &ldquo;perjured&rdquo; in memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is the second line which is the more astonishing; there Biron tells
      us that among the three of the Princess's women he loves &ldquo;the worst of
      all.&rdquo; Up to this moment we have only been told kindly things of Rosaline
      and the other ladies; we had no idea that any one of them was bad, much
      less that Rosaline was &ldquo;the worst of all.&rdquo; The suspicion grows upon us, a
      suspicion which is confirmed immediately afterwards, that Shakespeare is
      speaking of himself and of a particular woman; else we should have to
      admit that his portraiture of Rosaline's character was artistically bad,
      and bad without excuse, for why should he lavish all this wealth of
      unpleasant detail on a mere subsidiary character? He goes on, however, to
      make the fault worse; he next speaks of his love Rosaline as&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
  With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
    Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed;
  Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
    And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
  To pray for her! Go to! it is a plague.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is, of course, a blot upon the play for Biron to declare that his love
      is a wanton of the worst. It is not merely unexpected and uncalled-for; it
      diminishes our sympathy with Biron and his love, and also with the play.
      But we have already found the rule trustworthy that whenever Shakespeare
      makes a mistake in art it is because of some strong personal feeling and
      not for want of wit, and this rule evidently holds good here.
      Shakespeare-Biron is picturing the woman he himself loves; for not only
      does he describe her as a wanton to the detriment of the play; but he
      pictures her precisely, and this Rosaline is the only person in the play
      of whom we have any physical description at all. Moreover, he has given
      such precise and repeated photographs of no other character in any of his
      plays:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
  With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is certainly the same Rosaline we found depicted in &ldquo;Romeo and
      Juliet&rdquo;; but the portraiture here, both physical and moral, is more
      detailed and peculiar than it was in the earlier play. Shakespeare now
      knows his Rosaline intimately. The mere facts that here again her physical
      appearance is set forth with such particularity, and that the
      &ldquo;hard-heartedness&rdquo; which Mercutio noted in her has now become &ldquo;wantonness&rdquo;
       is all-important, especially when we remember that Miss Fitton was
      probably listening to the play. Even at Christmas, 1597, Shakespeare's
      passion has reached the height of a sex-duel. Miss Fitton has tortured him
      so that he delights in calling her names to her face in public when the
      play would have led one to expect ingratiating or complimentary
      courtesies. It does not weaken this argument to admit that the general
      audience would not perhaps have understood the allusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an almost incredible fact that not a single one of his hundreds of
      commentators has even noticed any peculiarity in this physical portraiture
      of Rosaline; Shakespeare uses this realism so rarely one would have
      thought that every critic would have been astounded by it; but no, they
      all pass over it without a word, Coleridge, Mr. Tyler, all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth act of &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost&rdquo; begins with a most characteristic
      soliloquy of Biron:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Biron</i>. The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
  myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in a
  pitch&mdash;pitch that defiles: defile! a foul word.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here Biron is manifestly playing on the &ldquo;pitch-balls&rdquo; his love has for
      eyes, and also on the &ldquo;foul faults&rdquo; Shakespeare speaks of in the sonnets
      and in Othello. Biron goes on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, but her eye&mdash;by this light, but for her eye, I
  would not love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do
  nothing in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
  heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme, and
  to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and
  here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my sonnets
  already: the clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady
  hath it: sweet clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This proves to me that some of Shakespeare's sonnets were written in 1597.
      True, Mr. Tyler would try to bind all the sonnets within the three years
      from 1598 to 1601, the three years which Shakespeare speaks about in
      sonnet 104:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                       &ldquo;Three winters cold
  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
  Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
  In process of the seasons have I seen.
  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
  Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Lord Herbert first came to Court in the spring of 1598, and so sonnet 104
      may have represented the fact precisely so far as Herbert was concerned;
      but I am not minded to take the poet so literally. Instead of beginning in
      the spring of 1598, some of the sonnets to the lady were probably written
      in the autumn of 1597, or even earlier, and yet Shakespeare would be quite
      justified in talking of three years, if the period ended in 1601. A poet
      is not to be bound to an almanack's exactitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fourth act of &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost,&rdquo; when Biron confesses his love
      for &ldquo;the heavenly Rosaline,&rdquo; the King banters him in the spirit of the
      time:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>King</i>. By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.

  <i>Biron</i>. Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
  A wife of such wood were felicity.
  O, who can give an oath? Where is a book?
  That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
  If that she learn not of her eye to look:
  No face is fair that is not full so black.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here we have Shakespeare again describing his mistress for us, though he
      has done it better earlier in the play; he harps upon her dark beauty here
      to praise it, just as he praised it in sonnet 127; it is passion's trick
      to sound the extremes of blame and praise alternately.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Elizabeth it was customary for poets and courtiers to
      praise red hair and a fair complexion as &ldquo;beauty's ensign,&rdquo; and so
      compliment the Queen. The flunkeyism, which is a characteristic of all the
      Germanic races, was peculiarly marked in England from the earliest times,
      and induced men, even in those &ldquo;spacious days,&rdquo; not only to overpraise
      fair hair, but to run down dark hair and eyes as ugly. The King replies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
    The hue of dungeons and the school of night;
  And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Biron answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
    O, if in black my lady's brow be deck'd
  It mourns that painting and usurping hair
    Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
  And therefore is she born to make black fair.
    Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
  For native blood is counted painting now;
    And therefore red that would avoid dispraise,
  Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Our timid poet is bold enough, when cloaked under a stage-name, to uphold
      the colour of his love's hair against the Queen's; the mere fact speaks
      volumes to those who know their Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sonnet 127 runs in almost the same words; though now the poet speaking in
      his own person is less bold:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;In the old age black was not counted fair,
    Or, if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
  But now is black beauty's successive heir,
    And beauty slandered with a bastard shame:
  For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
    Fairing the soul with art's false borrow'd face,
  Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
    But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
  Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
    Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
  At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
  Slandering creation with a false esteem:
  Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe
  That every tongue says beauty should look so.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt that in this Rosaline of &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; and of
      &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost,&rdquo; Shakespeare is describing the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; of the
      second sonnet-series, and describing her, against his custom in
      play-writing, even more exactly than he described her in the lyrics.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a line at the end of this act which is very characteristic when
      considered with what has gone before; it is clearly a confession of
      Shakespeare himself, and a perfect example of what one might call the
      conscience that pervades all his mature work:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      We were right, it seems, in putting some stress on that &ldquo;perjured&rdquo; when we
      first met it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second scene of the fifth act, which opens with a talk between the
      Princess and her ladies, our view of Rosaline is confirmed. Katherine
      calls Rosaline light, and jests upon this in lewd fashion; declares, too,
      that she is &ldquo;a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,&rdquo; in fact, tells her that
      she is
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A light condition in a beauty dark.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All these needless repetitions prove to me that Shakespeare is describing
      his mistress as she lived and moved. Those who disagree with me should
      give another instance in which he has used or abused the same precise
      portraiture. But there is more in this light badinage of the girls than a
      description of Rosaline. When Rosaline says that she will torture Biron
      before she goes, and turn him into her vassal, the Princess adds,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;None are so surely caught when they are catch'd
  As wit turned fool.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Rosaline replies,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The blood of youth burns not with such excess
  As gravity's revolt to wantonness.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This remark has no pertinence or meaning in Rosaline's mouth. Biron is
      supposed to be young in the play, and he has never been distinguished for
      his gravity, but for his wit and humour: the Princess calls him &ldquo;quick
      Biron.&rdquo; The two lines are clearly Shakespeare's criticism of himself. When
      he wrote the sonnets he thought himself old, and certainly his years
      (thirty-four) contrasted badly with those of Mary Fitton who was at this
      time not more than nineteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in 1597 then, before William Herbert came upon the scene at all,
      Shakespeare knew that his mistress was a wanton:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed;
  Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare has painted his love for us in these plays as a most
      extraordinary woman: in person she is tall, with pallid complexion and
      black eyes and black brows, &ldquo;a gipsy,&rdquo; he calls her; in nature imperious,
      lawless, witty, passionate&mdash;a &ldquo;wanton&rdquo;; moreover, a person of birth
      and position. That a girl of the time has been discovered who united all
      these qualities in herself would bring conviction to almost any mind; but
      belief passes into certitude when we reflect that this portrait of his
      mistress is given with greatest particularity in the plays, where in fact
      it is out of place and a fault in art. When studying the later plays we
      shall find this gipsy wanton again and again; she made the deepest
      impression on Shakespeare; was, indeed, the one love of his life. It was
      her falseness that brought him to self-knowledge and knowledge of life,
      and turned him from a light-hearted writer of comedies and histories into
      the author of the greatest tragedies that have ever been conceived.
      Shakespeare owes the greater part of his renown to Mary Fitton.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. THE SONNETS: PART III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The most interesting question in the sonnets, the question the vital
      importance of which dwarfs all others, has never yet been fairly tackled
      and decided. As soon as English critics noticed, a hundred years or so
      ago, that the sonnets fell into two series, and that the first, and
      longer, series was addressed to a young man, they cried, &ldquo;shocking!
      shocking!&rdquo; and registered judgement with smug haste on evidence that would
      not hang a cat. Hallam, &ldquo;the judicious,&rdquo; held that &ldquo;it would have been
      better for Shakespeare's reputation if the sonnets had never been
      written,&rdquo; and even Heine, led away by the consensus of opinion, accepted
      the condemnation, and regretted &ldquo;the miserable degradation of humanity&rdquo; to
      be found in the sonnets. But before giving ourselves to the novel
      enjoyment of moral superiority over Shakespeare, it may be worth while to
      ask, is the fact proved? is his guilt established?
    </p>
    <p>
      No one, I think, who has followed me so far will need to be told that I
      take no interest in white-washing Shakespeare: I am intent on painting him
      as he lived and loved, and if I found him as vicious as Villon, or as
      cruel as a stoat, I would set it all down as faithfully as I would give
      proof of his generosity or his gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the reader can fairly judge of Shakespeare's innocence or guilt, he
      must hold in mind two salient peculiarities of the man which I have
      already noted; but which must now be relieved out into due prominence so
      that one will make instinctive allowance for them at every moment, his
      sensuality and his snobbishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sensuality is the quality, as we have seen, which unites the creatures
      of his temperament with those of his intellect, his poets with his
      thinkers, and proves that Romeo and Jaques, the Duke of &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo;
       and Hamlet, are one and the same person. If the matter is fairly
      considered it will be found that this all-pervading sensuality is the
      source, or at least a natural accompaniment of his gentle kindness and his
      unrivalled sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare painted no portrait of the hero or of the adventurer; found no
      new word for the virile virtues or virile vices, but he gave immortal
      expression to desire and its offspring, to love, jealousy, and despair, to
      every form of pathos, pleading and pity, to all the gentler and more
      feminine qualities. Desire in especial has inspired him with phrases more
      magically expressive even than those gasped out by panting Sappho when
      lust had made her body a lyre of deathless music. Her lyric to the belovèd
      is not so intense as Othello's:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      &ldquo;O, thou weed
  Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
  That the sense aches at thee&rdquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      or as Cleopatra's astonishing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              &ldquo;There is gold, and here
  My bluest veins to kiss&rdquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;the revelation of a lifetime devoted to vanity and sensuality,
      sensuality pampered as a god and adored with an Eastern devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think I need labour this point further; as I have already
      noticed, Orsino, the Duke of &ldquo;Twelfth Night,&rdquo; sums up Shakespeare's
      philosophy of love in the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
  The appetite may sicken, and so die.&rdquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare told us the truth about himself when he wrote in sonnet 142,
      &ldquo;Love is my sin.&rdquo; We can expect from him new words or a new method in the
      painting of passionate desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second peculiarity of Shakespeare which we must establish firmly in
      our minds before we attempt to construe the sonnets is his extraordinary
      snobbishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      English snobbishness is like a London fog, intenser than can be found in
      any other country; it is so extravagant, indeed, that it seems different
      in kind. One instance of this: when Mr. Gladstone was being examined once
      in a case, he was asked by counsel, Was he a friend of a certain lord?
      Instead of answering simply that he was, he replied that he did not think
      it right to say he was a friend of so great a noble: &ldquo;he had the honour of
      his acquaintance.&rdquo; Only in England would the man who could make noblemen
      at will be found bowing before them with this humility of soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Shakespeare's time English snobbishness was stronger than it is to-day;
      it was then supported by law and enforced by penalties. To speak of a lord
      without his title was regarded as defamation, and was punished as such
      more than once by the Star Chamber. Shakespeare's position, too, explains
      how this native snobbishness in him was heightened to flunkeyism. He was
      an aristocrat born, as we have seen, and felt in himself a kinship for the
      courtesies, chivalries, and generosities of aristocratic life. This
      tendency was accentuated by his calling. The middle class, already steeped
      in Puritanism, looked upon the theatre as scarcely better than the
      brothel, and showed their contempt for the players in a thousand ways. The
      groundlings and common people, with their &ldquo;greasy caps&rdquo; and &ldquo;stinking
      breath&rdquo; were as loathsome to Shakespeare as the crop-headed, gain-loving
      citizens who condemned him and his like pitilessly. He was thrown back,
      therefore, upon the young noblemen who had read the classics and loved the
      arts. His works show how he admires them. He could paint you Bassanio or
      Benedick or Mercutio to the life. Everybody has noticed the predilection
      with which he lends such characters his own poetic spirit and charm. His
      lower orders are all food for comedy or farce: he will not treat them
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      His snobbishness carries him to astounding lengths. One instance: every
      capable critic has been astonished by the extraordinary fidelity to fact
      he shows in his historical plays; he often takes whole pages of an earlier
      play or of Plutarch, and merely varying the language uses them in his
      drama. He is punctiliously careful to set down the fact, whatever it may
      be, and explain it, even when it troubles the flow of his story; but as
      soon as the fact comes into conflict with his respect for dignitaries, he
      loses his nice conscience. He tells us of Agincourt without ever
      mentioning the fact that the English bowmen won the battle; he had the
      truth before him; the chronicler from whom he took the story vouched for
      the fact; but Shakespeare preferred to ascribe the victory to Henry and
      his lords. Shakespeare loved a lord with a passionate admiration, and when
      he paints himself it is usually as a duke or prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding these truths in our mind, Shakespeare's intense sensitiveness and
      sensuality, and his almost inconceivable snobbishness, we may now take up
      the sonnets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that strikes one in the sonnets is the fact that, though a
      hundred and twenty-five of them are devoted to a young man, and
      Shakespeare's affection for him, and only twenty-six to the woman, every
      one of those to the woman is characterized by a terrible veracity of
      passion, whereas those addressed to the youth are rather conventional than
      convincing. He pictures the woman to the life; strong, proud, with dark
      eyes and hair, pale complexion&mdash;a wanton with the rare power of
      carrying off even a wanton's shame. He finds a method new to literature to
      describe her. He will have no poetic exaggeration; snow is whiter than her
      breasts; violets sweeter than her breath:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
  As any she belied with false compare.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      His passion is so intense that he has no desire to paint her seduction as
      greater than it was. She has got into his blood, so to speak, and each
      drop of it under the microscope would show her image. Take any sonnet at
      haphazard, and you will hear the rage of his desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is the youth like?&mdash;&ldquo;the master-mistress&rdquo; of his passion, to
      give him the title which seems to have convinced the witless of
      Shakespeare's guilt. Not one word of description is to be found anywhere;
      no painting epithet&mdash;nothing. Where is the cry of this terrible,
      shameless, outrageous passion that mastered Shakespeare's conscience and
      enslaved his will? Hardly a phrase that goes beyond affection&mdash;such
      affection as Shakespeare at thirty-four might well feel for a gifted,
      handsome aristocrat like Lord Herbert, who had youth, beauty, wealth, wit
      to recommend him. Herbert was a poet, too: a patron unparagoned! &ldquo;If
      Southampton gave me a thousand pounds,&rdquo; Shakespeare may well have argued,
      &ldquo;perhaps Lord Herbert will get me made Master of the Revels, or even give
      me a higher place.&rdquo; An aristocratic society tends to make parasites even
      of the strong, as Dr. Johnson's famous letter to Lord Chesterfield proves.
      But let us leave supposition and come to the sonnets themselves, which are
      addressed to the youth. The first sonnet begins:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;From fairest creatures we desire increase,
  That thereby beauty's rose might never die.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is a very good argument indeed when addressed to a woman; but when
      addressed to a man by a man it rings strained and false. Yet it is the
      theme of the first seventeen sonnets. It is precisely the same argument
      which Shakespeare set forth in &ldquo;Venus and Adonis&rdquo; again and again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty;
  Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.&rdquo;
   &ldquo;And so, in spite of death, thou dost survive,
  In that thy likeness still is left alive ...&rdquo;
 (173-4.)

  &ldquo;Foul cankering rust the hidden treasure frets,
  But gold that's put to use more gold begets.&rdquo;
 (767-8.)
</pre>
    <p>
      At the end of the third sonnet we find the same argument:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
  Die single, and thine image dies with thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again, in the fourth, sixth, and seventh sonnets the same plea is urged.
      In the tenth sonnet the poet cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Make thee another self, for love of me,
  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And again at the end of the thirteenth sonnet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;You had a father; let your son say so.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Every one of these sonnets contains simply the argument which is set forth
      with equal force and far superior pertinence in &ldquo;Venus and Adonis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is, Shakespeare makes use of the passion he has felt for a woman to
      give reality to the expression of his affection for the youth. No better
      proof could be imagined of the fact that he never loved the youth with
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sonnet 18 Shakespeare begins to alter his note. He then tells the youth
      that he will achieve immortality, not through his children, but through
      Shakespeare's verses. Sonnet 19 is rounded with the same thought:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Yet do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Sonnet 20 is often referred to as suggesting intimacy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted,
  Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
  A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
  With shifting change, as is false woman's fashion;
  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling
  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
  A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,
  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
  And for a woman wert thou first created;
  Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
  And by addition me of thee defeated,
  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
    But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure
    Mine be thy love, and thy love's use their treasure.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The sextet of this sonnet absolutely disproves guilty intimacy, and is, I
      believe, intended to disprove it; Shakespeare had already fathomed the
      scandal-loving minds of his friends, and wanted to set forth the noble
      disinterestedness of his affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sonnet 22 is more sincere, though not so passionate; it neither
      strengthens nor rebuts the argument. Sonnet 23 is the sonnet upon which
      all those chiefly rely who wish to condemn Shakespeare. Here it is:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;As an unperfect actor on the stage,
  Who with his fear is put beside his part,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
  So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might.
  O, let my looks be then the eloquence
  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast;
  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
  More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
    O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:
    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      We can interpret the phrases, &ldquo;the perfect ceremony of love's rite&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;look for recompense&rdquo; as we will; but it must be admitted that even when
      used to the uttermost they form an astonishingly small base on which to
      raise so huge and hideous a superstructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we shall be told that the condemnation of Shakespeare is based, not
      upon any sonnet or any line; but upon the way Shakespeare speaks as soon
      as he discovers that his mistress has betrayed him in favour of his
      friend. One is inclined to expect that he will throw the blame on the
      friend, and, after casting him off, seek to win again the affections of
      his mistress. Nine men out of ten would act in this way. But the sonnets
      tell us with iteration and most peculiar emphasis that Shakespeare does
      not condemn the friend. As soon as he hears of the traitorism he cries
      (sonnet 33):
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Full many a glorious morning have I seen
  Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchymy;
  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
  And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
  Even so my sun one early morn did shine
  With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
  But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,
  The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
    Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is the loss of his friend he regrets, rather than the loss of his
      mistress; she is not mentioned save by comparison with &ldquo;basest clouds.&rdquo;
       Yet even when read by Gradgrind and his compeers the thirteenth line of
      this sonnet is utterly inconsistent with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next sonnet the friend repents, and weeps the &ldquo;strong offence,&rdquo; and
      Shakespeare accepts the sorrow as salve that &ldquo;heals the wound&rdquo;; his
      friend's tears are pearls that &ldquo;ransom all ill deeds.&rdquo; The next sonnet
      begins with the line:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done&rdquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare will be an &ldquo;accessory&rdquo; to his friend's &ldquo;theft,&rdquo; though he
      admits that the robbery is still sour. Then come four sonnets in which he
      is content to forget all about the wrong he has suffered, and simply
      exhausts himself in praise of his friend. Sonnet 40 begins:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;
  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
  No love, my love, that thou may'st true love call;  All mine was
thine, before thou hadst this more.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is surely the very soul of tender affection; but it is significant
      that even here the word &ldquo;true&rdquo; is emphasized and not &ldquo;love&rdquo;; he goes on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
  Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
  And yet love knows it is a greater grief
  To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Never before was a man so gentle-kind; we might be listening to the lament
      of a broken-hearted woman who smiles through her tears to reassure her
      lover; yet there is no attempt to disguise the fact that Herbert has done
      &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo; The next sonnet puts the poet's feeling as strongly as possible.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
  Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,
  For still temptation follows where thou art.
  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;
  And when a woman woos, what woman's son
  Will sourly leave her till she have prevail'd?
  Ay me! but yet thou might'st my seat forbear,
  And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
  Who lead thee in their riot even there
  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth;
  Hers, by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
  Thine by thy beauty being false to me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The first lines show that Shakespeare is pretending; he attempts not only
      to minimize the offence, but to find it charming. A mother who caught her
      young son kissing a girl would reproach him in this fashion; to her his
      faults would be the &ldquo;pretty wrongs that liberty commits.&rdquo; But this is not
      the way passion speaks, and here again the sextet condemns Herbert in the
      plainest terms. At length we have the summing-up:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,
  And yet it may be said I lov'd her dearly;
  That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,
  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
  Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:
  Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;
  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
  Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
  But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
  Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This sonnet, with its affected word-play and wire-drawn consolation,
      leaves one gaping: Shakespeare's verbal affectations had got into his very
      blood. To my mind the whole sonnet is too extravagant to be sincere; it is
      only to be explained by the fact that Shakespeare's liking for Herbert was
      heightened by snobbishness and by the hope of patronage. None of it rings
      true except the first couplet. Yet the argument of it is repeated, strange
      to say, and emphasized in the sonnets addressed to the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; whom
      Shakespeare loved. Sonnet 144 is clear enough:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
  Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
  The better angel is a man, right fair,
  The worser spirit a woman, colour'd ill.
  To win me soon to hell, my female evil
  Tempteth my better angel from my side,
  And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
  Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
  And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
  Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
  But being both from me, both to each friend,
  I guess one angel in another's hell:
    Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
    Till my bad angel fire my good one out.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As soon as his mistress comes on the scene Shakespeare's passionate
      sincerity cannot be questioned. The truth is the intensity of his passion
      leads him to condemn and spite the woman, while the absence of passion
      allows him to pretend affection for the friend. Sonnet 133, written to the
      woman, is decisive:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
  For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
  Is't not enough to torture me alone,
  But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
  Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
  And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
  Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;
  A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.
  Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
  But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
  Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
  Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol:
    And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
    Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The last couplet is to me &ldquo;perforce&rdquo; conclusive. But let us take it that
      these sonnets prove the contention of the cry of critics that Shakespeare
      preferred friendship to love, and held his friend dearer than his
      mistress, and let us see if the plays corroborate the sonnets on this
      point. We may possibly find that the plays only strengthen the doubt which
      the sonnets implant in us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice&rdquo; has always seemed to me important as helping to
      fix the date of the sonnets. Antonio, as I have shown, is an impersonation
      of Shakespeare himself. It seems to me Shakespeare would have found it
      impossible to write of Antonio's self-sacrificing love for Bassanio after
      he himself had been cheated by his friend. This play then must have been
      written shortly before his betrayal, and should give us Shakespeare's
      ordinary attitude. Many expressions in the play remind us of the sonnets,
      and one in especial of sonnet 41. In the sixth scene of the second act,
      Jessica, when escaping from her father's house, uses Shakespeare's voice
      to say:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;But love is blind and lovers cannot see
  The pretty follies that themselves commit.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here we have &ldquo;the pretty follies&rdquo; which is used again as &ldquo;pretty wrongs&rdquo;
       in sonnet 41. Immediately afterwards Lorenzo, another mask of Shakespeare,
      praises Jessica as &ldquo;wise, fair, and true,&rdquo; just as in sonnet 105
      Shakespeare praises his friend as &ldquo;kind, fair, and true,&rdquo; using again
      words which his passion for a woman has taught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth act sets forth the same argument we find in the sonnets. When
      it looks as if Antonio would have to give his life as forfeit to the Jew,
      Bassanio exclaims:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Antonio, I am married to a wife
  Which is as dear to me as life itself;
  But life itself, my wife and all the world
  Are not with me esteem'd above thy life.
  I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
  Here to this devil to deliver you.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is the language of passionate exaggeration, one might say. Antoniois
      suffering in Bassanio's place, paying the penalty, so to speak, for
      Bassanio's happiness. No wonder Bassanio exaggerates his grief and the
      sacrifice he would be prepared to make. But Gratiano has no such excuse
      for extravagant speech, and yet Gratiano follows in the self-same vein:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I have a wife whom, I protest, I love:
  I would she were in heaven, so she could
  Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The peculiarity of this attitude is heightened by the fact that the two
      wives, Portia and Nerissa, both take the ordinary view. Portia says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Your wife would give you little thanks for that
  If she were by to hear you make the offer.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And Nerissa goes a little further:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Tis well you offer it behind her back,
   The wish would make else an unquiet house.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The blunder is monstrous; not only is the friend prepared to sacrifice all
      he possesses, including his wife, to save his benefactor, but the friend's
      friend is content to sacrifice his wife too for the same object.
      Shakespeare then in early manhood was accustomed to put friendship before
      love; we must find some explanation of what seems to us so unnatural an
      attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last scene of &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona,&rdquo; which is due to a
      later revision, the sonnet-case is emphasized. And at this time
      Shakespeare has suffered Herbert's betrayal. As soon as the false friend
      Proteus says he is sorry and asks forgiveness, Valentine, another
      impersonation of Shakespeare, replies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Then I am paid;
  And once again I do receive thee honest:
  Who by repentance is not satisfied,
  Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleas'd;
  By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased;
  And that my love may appear plain and free,
  All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This incarnation of Shakespeare speaks of repentance in Shakespeare's most
      characteristic fashion, and then coolly surrenders the woman he loves to
      his friend without a moment's hesitation, and without even considering
      whether the woman would be satisfied with the transfer. The words admit of
      no misconstruction; they stand four-square, not to be shaken by any
      ingenuity of reason, and Shakespeare supplies us with further
      corroboration of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coriolanus&rdquo; was written fully ten years after &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice,&rdquo;
       and long after the revision of &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona.&rdquo; And yet
      Shakespeare's attitude at forty-three is, in regard to this matter, just
      what it was at thirty-three. When Aufidius finds Coriolanus in his house,
      and learns that he has been banished from Rome and is now prepared to turn
      his army against his countrymen, he welcomes him as &ldquo;more a friend than
      e'er an enemy,&rdquo; and this is the way he takes to show his joy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                        &ldquo;Know thou first,
  I loved the maid I married: never man
  Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
  Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
  Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
  Bestride my threshold.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here's the same attitude; the same extravagance; the same insistence on
      the fact that the man loves the maid and yet has more delight in the
      friend. What does it mean? When we first find it in &ldquo;The Merchant of
      Venice&rdquo; it must give the reader pause; in &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; it
      surprises us; in the sonnets, accompanied as it is by every flattering
      expression of tender affection for the friend, it brings us to question;
      but its repetition in &ldquo;Coriolanus&rdquo; must assure us that it is a mere pose.
      Aufidius was not such a friend of Coriolanus that we can take his
      protestation seriously. The argument is evidently a stock argument to
      Shakespeare: a part of the ordinary furniture of his mind: it is like a
      fashionable dress of the period&mdash;the wearer does not notice its
      peculiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, Shakespeare found in the literature of his time, and in the
      minds of his contemporaries, a fantastically high appreciation of
      friendship, coupled with a corresponding disdain for love as we moderns
      understand it. In &ldquo;Wit's Commonwealth,&rdquo; published in 1598, we find: &ldquo;The
      love of men to women is a thing common and of course, but the friendship
      of man to man, infinite and immortal.&rdquo; Passionate devotion to friendship
      is a sort of mark of the Renaissance, and the words &ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;lover&rdquo; in
      Elizabethan English were commonly used for &ldquo;friend&rdquo; and &ldquo;friendship.&rdquo;
       Moreover, one must not forget that Lyly, whose euphuistic speech affected
      Shakespeare for years, had handled this same incident in his &ldquo;Campaspe,&rdquo;
       where Alexander gives up his love to his rival, Apelles. Shakespeare, not
      to be outdone in any loyalty, sets forth the same fantastical devotion in
      the sonnets and plays. He does this, partly because the spirit of the time
      infected him, partly out of sincere admiration for Herbert, but oftener, I
      imagine, out of self-interest. It is pose, flunkeyism and the hope of
      benefits to come and not passion that inspired the first series of
      sonnets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever reads the scene carefully in &ldquo;Much Ado About Nothing,&rdquo; cannot
      avoid seeing that Shakespeare at his best not only does not minimize his
      friend's offence, but condemns it absolutely:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The transgression is in the stealer.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And in the sonnets, too, in spite of himself, the same true feeling
      pierces through the snobbish and affected excuses.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ay me! but yet them might'st my seat forbear,
  And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,
  Who lead thee in their riot even there
  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,
    Hers, by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
    Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was a sycophant, a flunkey if you will, but nothing worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further arguments suggest themselves. Shakespeare lived, as it were, in a
      glass house with a score of curious eyes watching everything he did and
      with as many ears pricked for every word he said; but this foul accusation
      was never even suggested by any of his rivals. In especial Ben Jonson was
      always girding at Shakespeare, now satirically, now good-humouredly. Is it
      not manifest that if any such sin had ever been attributed to him, Ben
      Jonson would have given the suspicion utterance? There is a passage in his
      &ldquo;Bartholomew Fair&rdquo; which I feel sure is meant as a skit upon the relations
      we find in the Sonnets. In Act V, scene iii, there is a puppet-show
      setting forth &ldquo;the ancient modern history of Hero and Leander, otherwise
      called the Touchstone of true Love, with as true a trial of Friendship
      between Damon and Pythias, two faithful friends o' the Bankside.&rdquo; Hero is
      a &ldquo;wench o' the Bankside,&rdquo; and Leander swims across the Thames to her.
      Damon and Pythias meet at her lodgings, and abuse each other violently,
      only to finish as perfect good friends.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;<i>Damon</i>. Whore-master in thy face;
  Thou hast lain with her thyself, I'll prove it in this place.

    <i>Leatherhead</i>. They are whore-masters both, sir, that's
       a plain case.

    <i>Pythias</i>. Thou lie like a rogue.

    <i>Leatherhead</i>. Do I lie like a rogue?

    <i>Pythias</i>. A pimp and a scab.

 </pre>
    <p>
      Rare Ben Jonson would have been delighted to set forth the viler charge if
      it had ever been whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then again, it seems to me certain that if Shakespeare had been the sort
      of man his accusers say he was, he would have betrayed himself in his
      plays. Consider merely the fact that young boys then played the girls'
      parts on the stage. Surely if Shakespeare had had any leaning that way, we
      should have found again and again ambiguous or suggestive expressions
      given to some of these boys when aping girls; but not one. The temptation
      was there; the provocation was there, incessant and prolonged for
      twenty-five years, and yet, to my knowledge, Shakespeare has never used
      one word that malice could misconstrue. Yet he loved suggestive and lewd
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, however, there is stronger proof of Shakespeare's innocence than
      even his condemnation of his false friend, proof so strong, that if all
      the arguments for his guilt were tenfold stronger than they are, this
      proof would outweigh them all and bring them to nought. Nor should it be
      supposed, because I have only mentioned the chief arguments for and
      against, that I do not know all those that can be urged on either side. I
      have confined myself to the chief ones simply because by merely stating
      them, their utter weakness must be admitted by every one who can read
      Shakespeare, by every one who understands his impulsive sensitiveness, and
      the facility with which affectionate expressions came to his lips.
      Moreover, it must not be forgotten that while the sonnets were being
      written he was in rivalry with Chapman for this very patron's favour, and
      this rivalry alone would explain a good deal of the fervour, or, should I
      say, the affected fervour he put into the first series of sonnets; but now
      for the decisive and convincing argument for Shakespeare's innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us first ask ourselves how it is that real passion betrays itself and
      proves its force. Surely it is by its continuance; by its effect upon the
      life later. I have assumed, or inferred, as my readers may decide, that
      Shakespeare's liking for Herbert was chiefly snobbish, and was deepened by
      the selfish hope that he would find in him a patron even more powerful and
      more liberally disposed than Lord Southampton. He probably felt that young
      Herbert owed him a great deal for his companionship and poetical advice;
      for Herbert was by way of being a poet himself. If my view is correct,
      after Shakespeare lost Lord Herbert's affection, we should expect to hear
      him talking of man's forgetfulness and ingratitude, and that is just what
      Lord Herbert left in him, bitterness and contempt. Never one word in all
      his works to show that the loss of this youth's affection touched him more
      nearly. As we have seen, he cannot keep the incident out of his plays.
      Again and again he drags it in; but in none of these dramas is there any
      lingering kindness towards the betrayer. And as soon as the incident was
      past and done with, as soon as the three or four years' companionship with
      Lord Herbert was at an end, not one word more do we catch expressive of
      affection. Again and again Shakespeare rails at man's ingratitude, but
      nothing more. Think of it. Pembroke, under James, came to great power;
      was, indeed, made Lord Chamberlain, and set above all the players, so that
      he could have advanced Shakespeare as he pleased with a word: with a word
      could have made him Master of the Revels, or given him a higher post. He
      did not help him in any way. He gave books every Christmas to Ben Jonson,
      but we hear of no gift to Shakespeare, though evidently from the
      dedication to him of the first folio, he remained on terms of careless
      acquaintance with Shakespeare. Ingratitude is what Shakespeare found in
      Lord Pembroke; ingratitude is what he complains of in him. What a
      different effect the loss of Mary Fitton had upon Shakespeare. Just
      consider what the plays teach us when the sonnet-story is finished. The
      youth vanishes; no reader can find a trace of him, or even an allusion to
      him. But the woman comes to be the centre, as we shall see, of tragedy
      after tragedy. She flames through Shakespeare's life, a fiery symbol, till
      at length she inspires perhaps his greatest drama, &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo;
       filling it with the disgrace of him who is &ldquo;a strumpet's fool,&rdquo; the shame
      of him who has become &ldquo;the bellows and the fan to cool a harlot's lust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The passion for Mary Fitton was the passion of Shakespeare's whole life.
      The adoration of her, and the insane desire of her, can be seen in every
      play he wrote from 1597 to 1608. After he lost her, he went back to her;
      but the wound of her frailty cankered and took on proud flesh in him, and
      tortured him to nervous breakdown and to madness. When at length he won to
      peace, after ten years, it was the peace of exhaustion. His love for his
      &ldquo;gipsy-wanton&rdquo; burned him out, as one is burnt to ashes at the stake, and
      his passion only ended with his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no room for doubt in my mind, no faintest suspicion. Hallam and
      Heine, and all the cry of critics, are mistaken in this matter.
      Shakespeare admired Lord Herbert's youth and boldness and beauty, hoped
      great things from his favour and patronage; but after the betrayal, he
      judged him inexorably as a mean traitor, &ldquo;a stealer&rdquo; who had betrayed &ldquo;a
      twofold trust&rdquo;; and later, cursed him for his ingratitude, and went about
      with wild thoughts of bloody revenge, as we shall soon see in &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Othello,&rdquo; and then dropped him into oblivion without a pang.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is bad enough to know that Shakespeare, the sweetest spirit and finest
      mind in all literature, should have degraded himself to pretend such an
      affection for the profligate Herbert as has given occasion for
      misconstruction. It is bad enough, I say, to know that Shakespeare could
      play flunkey to this extent; but after all, that is the worst that can be
      urged against him, and it is so much better than men have been led to
      believe that there may be a certain relief in the knowledge.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. THE FIRST-FRUIT OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: BRUTUS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The play of &ldquo;Julius Caesar&rdquo; was written about 1600 or 1601. As &ldquo;Twelfth
      Night&rdquo; was the last of the golden comedies, so &ldquo;Julius Caesar&rdquo; is the
      first of the great tragedies, and bears melancholy witness to us that the
      poet's young-eyed confidence in life and joy in living are dying, if not
      dead. &ldquo;Julius Caesar&rdquo; is the first outcome of disillusion. Before it was
      written Shakespeare had been deceived by his mistress, betrayed by his
      friend; his eyes had been opened to the fraud and falsehood of life; but,
      like one who has just been operated on for cataract, he still sees
      realities as through a mist, dimly. He meets the shock of traitorous
      betrayal as we should have expected Valentine or Antonio or Orsino to meet
      it&mdash;with pitying forgiveness. Suffering, instead of steeling his
      heart and drying up his sympathies, as it does with most men, softened
      him, induced him to give himself wholly to that &ldquo;angel, Pity.&rdquo; He will not
      believe that his bitter experience is universal; in spite of Herbert's
      betrayal, he still has the courage to declare his belief in the existence
      of the ideal. At the very last his defeated Brutus cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
  I found no man but he was true to me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The pathos of this attempt still to believe in man and man's truth is over
      the whole play. But the belief was fated to disappear. No man who lives in
      the world can boast of loyalty as Brutus did; even Jesus had a Judas among
      the Twelve. But when Shakespeare wrote &ldquo;Julius Caesar&rdquo; he still tried to
      believe, and this gives the play an important place in his life's story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I begin to consider the character of Brutus I should like to draw
      attention to three passages which place Brutus between the melancholy
      Jaques of &ldquo;As You Like It,&rdquo; whose melancholy is merely temperamental, and
      the almost despairing Hamlet. Jaques says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Invest me in my motley; give me leave
  To speak my mind, and I will through and through
  Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
  If they will patiently receive my medicine.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is the view of early manhood which does not doubt its power to cure
      all the evils which afflict mortality. Then comes the later, more hopeless
      view, to which Brutus gives expression:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this;
  Brutus had rather be a villager
  Than to repute himself a son of Rome
  Under these hard conditions as this time
  Is like to lay upon us.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And later still, and still more bitter, Hamlet's:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The time is out of joint; O cursed spite,
  That ever I was born to set it right!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But Shakespeare is a meliorist even in Hamlet, and believes that the
      ailments of man can all be set right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The likenesses between Brutus and Hamlet are so marked that even the
      commentators have noticed them. Professor Dowden exaggerates the
      similarities. &ldquo;Both (dramas),&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;are tragedies of thought rather
      than of passion; both present in their chief characters the spectacle of
      noble natures which fail through some weakness or deficiency rather than
      through crime; upon Brutus as upon Hamlet a burden is laid which he is not
      able to bear; neither Brutus nor Hamlet is fitted for action, yet both are
      called to act in dangerous and difficult affairs.&rdquo; Much of this is
      Professor Dowden's view and not Shakespeare's. When Shakespeare wrote
      &ldquo;Julius Caesar&rdquo; he had not reached that stage in self-understanding when
      he became conscious that he was a man of thought rather than of action,
      and that the two ideals tend to exclude each other. In the contest at
      Philippi Brutus and his wing win the day; it is the defeat of Cassius
      which brings about the ruin; Shakespeare evidently intended to depict
      Brutus as well &ldquo;fitted for action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some critics find it disconcerting that Shakespeare identified himself
      with Brutus, who failed, rather than with Caesar, who succeeded. But even
      before he himself came to grief in his love and trust, Shakespeare had
      always treated the failures with peculiar sympathy. He preferred Arthur to
      the Bastard, and King Henry VI. to Richard III., and Richard II. to proud
      Bolingbroke. And after his agony of disillusion, all his heroes are
      failures for years and years: Brutus, Hamlet, Macbeth, Lear, Troilus,
      Antony, and Timon&mdash;all fail as he himself had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is some matter for surprise in the fact that Brutus is an ideal
      portrait of Shakespeare. Disillusion usually brings a certain bitter
      sincerity, a measure of realism, into artistic work; but its first effect
      on Shakespeare was to draw out all the kindliness in him; Brutus is
      Shakespeare at his sweetest and best. Yet the soul-suffering of the man
      has assuredly improved his art: Brutus is a better portrait of him than
      Biron, Valentine, Romeo, or Antonio, a more serious and bolder piece of
      self-revealing even than Orsino. Shakespeare is not afraid now to depict
      the deep underlying kindness of his nature, his essential goodness of
      heart. A little earlier, and occupied chiefly with his own complex growth,
      he could only paint sides of himself; a little later, and the personal
      interest absorbed all others, so that his dramas became lyrics of anguish
      and despair. Brutus belongs to the best time, artistically speaking, to
      the time when passion and pain had tried the character without benumbing
      the will or distracting the mind: it is a masterpiece of portraiture, and
      stands in even closer relation to Hamlet than Romeo stands to Orsino. As
      Shakespeare appears to us in Brutus at thirty-seven, so he was when they
      bore him to his grave at fifty-two&mdash;the heart does not alter greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let no one say or think that in all this I am drawing on my imagination;
      what I have said is justified by all that Brutus says and does from one
      end of the play to the other. According to his custom, Shakespeare has
      said it all of himself very plainly, and has put his confession into the
      mouth of Brutus on his very first appearance (Act i. sc. 2):
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                 &ldquo;Cassius
  Be not deceived: if I have veiled my look
  I turn the trouble of my countenance
  Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
  Of late with passions of some difference,
  Conceptions only proper to myself,
  Which gives some soil, perhaps, to my behaviours,
  But let not therefore my good friends be grieved,&mdash;
  Among which number, Cassius, be you one,&mdash;
  Nor construe any further in neglect,
  Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
  Forgets the shows of love to other men.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      What were these &ldquo;different passions,&rdquo; complex personal passions, too,
      which had vexed Brutus and changed his manners even to his friends? There
      is no hint of them in Plutarch, no word about them in the play. It was not
      &ldquo;poor Brutus,&rdquo; but poor Shakespeare, racked by love and jealousy, tortured
      by betrayal, who was now &ldquo;at war with himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assume the identity of Brutus with Shakespeare before I have absolutely
      proved it because it furnishes the solution to the difficulties of the
      play. As usual, Coleridge has given proof of his insight by seeing and
      stating the chief difficulty, without, however, being able to explain it,
      and as usual, also, the later critics have followed him as far as they
      can, and in this case have elected to pass over the difficulty in silence.
      Coleridge quotes some of the words of Brutus when he first thinks of
      killing Caesar, and calls the passage a speech of Brutus, but it is in
      reality a soliloquy of Brutus, and must be considered in its entirety.
      Brutus says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;It must be by his death: and for my part,
  I know no personal cause to spurn at him
  But for the general. He would be crowned:&mdash;
  How that might change his nature, there's the question?
  It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,
  And that craves wary walking. Crown him?&mdash;that;
  And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
  That at his will he may do danger with.
  The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
  Remorse from power: and to speak truth of Caesar,
  I have known his affections swayed
  More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
  That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
  Whereto the climber-upwards turns his face;
  But when he once attains the topmost round,
  He then unto the ladder turns his back,
  Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
  By which he did ascend. So Caesar may:
  Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel
  Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
  Fashion it thus: that, what he is, augmented,
  Would run to these and these extremities:
  And therefore think him as a serpent's egg,
  Which, hatched, would as his kind grow mischievous;
  And kill him in the shell.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Coleridge's comment on this deserves notice. He wrote: &ldquo;This speech is
      singular; at least, I do not at present see into Shakespeare's motive, his
      <i>rationale</i>, or in what point of view he meant Brutus' character to
      appear. For surely ... nothing can seem more discordant with our
      historical preconceptions of Brutus, or more lowering to the intellect of
      the Stoico-Platonic tyrannicide, than the tenets here attributed to him&mdash;to
      him, the stern Roman republican; namely, that he would have no objection
      to a king, or to Caesar, a monarch in Rome, would Caesar but be as good a
      monarch as he now seems disposed to be! How, too, could Brutus say that he
      found no personal cause&mdash;none in Caesar's past conduct as a man? Had
      he not passed the Rubicon? Had he not entered Rome as a conqueror? Had he
      not placed his Gauls in the Senate? Shakespeare, it may be said, has not
      brought these things forward. True;&mdash;and this is just the ground of
      my perplexity. What character did Shakespeare mean his Brutus to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this is sound criticism, and can only be answered by the truth that
      Shakespeare from the beginning of the play identified himself with Brutus,
      and paid but little attention to the historic Brutus whom he had met in
      Plutarch. Let us push criticism a little further, and we shall see that
      this is the only possible way to read the riddle. We all know why
      Plutarch's Brutus killed Caesar; but why does Shakespeare's Brutus kill
      the man he so esteems? Because Caesar may change his nature when king;
      because like the serpent's egg he may &ldquo;grow mischievous&rdquo;? But when he
      speaks &ldquo;truth&rdquo; of Caesar he has to admit Caesar's goodness. The &ldquo;serpent's
      egg&rdquo; reason then is inapplicable. Besides, when speaking of himself on the
      plains of Philippi, Shakespeare's Brutus explicitly contradicts this false
      reasoning:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                       &ldquo;I know not how
  But I do find it cowardly and vile,
  <i>For fear of what might fall</i>, so to prevent
  The term of life.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It would seem, therefore, that Brutus did not kill Caesar, as one crushes
      a serpent's egg, to prevent evil consequences. It is equally manifest that
      he did not do it for &ldquo;the general,&rdquo; for if ever &ldquo;the general&rdquo; were shown
      to be despicable and worthless it is in this very play, where the citizens
      murder Cinna the poet because he has the same name as Cinna the
      conspirator, and the lower classes are despised as the &ldquo;rabblement,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
      common herd,&rdquo; with &ldquo;chapped hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;sweaty night-caps,&rdquo; and &ldquo;stinking
      breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is Dr. Brandes' idea and not Shakespeare's that Brutus is a &ldquo;man of
      uncompromising character and principle.&rdquo; That is the Brutus of Plutarch,
      who finds in his stern republican love of the common good an ethical
      motive for killing the ambitious Caesar. But Shakespeare had no
      understanding of the republican ideal, and no sympathy with the public;
      accordingly, his Brutus has no adequate reason for contriving Caesar's
      death. Shakespeare followed Plutarch in freeing Brutus from the suspicion
      of personal or interested motive, but he didn't see that by doing this he
      made his Brutus a conspirator without a cause, a murderer without a motive.
      The truth is our gentle poet could never find a convincing ground for
      cold-blooded murder. It will be remembered that Macbeth only murders, as
      the deer murders, out of fear, and the fact that his Brutus can find no
      justification of any sort for killing Caesar, confirms our view of
      Shakespeare's gentle kindness. The &ldquo;uncompromising character and
      principle&rdquo; of the severe republican we find in Plutarch, sit uneasily on
      Shakespeare's Brutus; it is apparent that the poet had no conception of
      what we call a fanatic. His difficulties arise from this limitation of
      insight. He begins to write the play by making Brutus an idealized
      portrait of himself; he, therefore, dwells on Brutus' perfect nobility,
      sincerity, and unselfishness, but does not realize that the more perfect
      he makes Brutus, the more clear and cogent Brutus' motive must be for
      undertaking Caesar's assassination.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this confusion Shakespeare's usually fine instinct is at fault, and he
      blunders from mistake to mistake. His idealizing tendency makes him
      present Brutus as perfect, and at the same time he uses the historical
      incident of the anonymous letters, which goes to show Brutus as conceited
      and vain. If these letters influenced Brutus&mdash;and they must be taken
      to have done so, or else why were they introduced?&mdash;we have a noble
      and unselfish man murdering out of paltry vanity. In Plutarch, where
      Brutus is depicted as an austere republican, the incident of the letters
      only throws a natural shade of doubt on the rigid principles by which
      alone he is supposed to be guided. We all feel that rigid principles rest
      on pride, and may best be led astray through pride. But Shakespeare's
      Brutus is pure human sweetness, and the letters are worse than out of
      place when addressed to him. Shakespeare should never have used this
      incident; it is a blot on his conception.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the first acts of the play Brutus is incredible, for he is in
      an impossible position. Shakespeare simply could not find any valid reason
      why his <i>alter ego</i>, Brutus, should kill Caesar. But from the moment
      the murder is committed to the end of the play Brutus- Shakespeare is at
      peace with himself. And as soon as the dramatist lets himself go and
      paints Brutus with entire freedom and frankness, he rises to the height of
      tragic pathos, and we can all recognize the original of the portrait. At
      first Brutus is merely ideal; his perfect unsuspiciousness&mdash;he trusts
      even Antony; his transparent honesty&mdash;he will have no other oath
      among the conspirators
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Than honesty to honesty engaged&rdquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      his hatred of bloodshed&mdash;he opposes Cassius, who proposes to murder
      Antony; all these noble qualities may be contrasted with the subtler
      shortcomings which make of Hamlet so vital a creation. Hamlet is
      suspicious even of Ophelia; Hamlet is only &ldquo;indifferent honest&rdquo;; Hamlet
      makes his friends swear to keep the ghost's appearance a profound secret;
      Hamlet lives from the beginning, while Brutus at first is a mere bundle of
      perfections individualized only by that personal intimate confession which
      I have already quoted, which, however, has nothing to do with the play.
      But later in the drama Shakespeare begins to lend Brutus his own
      weaknesses, and forthwith Brutus lives. His insomnia is pure Shakespeare:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
  I have not slept.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The character of Brutus is superbly portrayed in that wonderful scene with
      Cassius in the fourth act. With all the superiority of conscious genius he
      treats his confederate as a child or madman, much as Hamlet treats
      Rosencrantz and Guildenstern:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Cassius is mean, too, whereas Brutus is kindly and generous to a degree:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;For I can raise no money by vile means:
  By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
  And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
  From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
  By any indirection....
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
  To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
  Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
  Dash him to pieces.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And, above all, as soon as Cassius appeals to his affection, Brutus is
      disarmed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
  That carries anger, as the flint bears fire;
  Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
  And straight is cold again.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is the best expression of Shakespeare's temper; the &ldquo;hasty spark&rdquo; is
      Hamlet's temper, as we have seen, and Macbeth's, and Romeo's.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now everything that Brutus does or says is Shakespeare's best. In a
      bowl of wine he buries &ldquo;all unkindness.&rdquo; His affection for Cassius is not
      a virtue to one in especial. The scene in the fourth act, in which he begs
      the pardon of his boy Lucius, should be learned by heart by those who wish
      to understand our loving and lovable Shakespeare. This scene, be it
      remarked, is not in Plutarch, but is Shakespeare's own invention. His care
      for the lad's comfort, at a time when his own life is striking the supreme
      hour, is exquisitely pathetic. Then come his farewell to Cassius and his
      lament over Cassius' body; then the second fight and the nobly generous
      words that hold in them, as flowers their perfume, all Shakespeare's
      sweetness of nature:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My heart doth joy, that yet in all my life
  I found no man, but he was true to me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then night hangs upon the weary, sleepless eyes, and we are all ready
      to echo Antony's marvellous valediction:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;This was the noblest Roman of them all;
      - -     - -     - -     - -     - -     - -
   His life was gentle; and the elements
   So mixed in him, that Nature might stand up
   And say to all the world, 'This was a man!'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But this Brutus was no murderer, no conspirator, no narrow republican
      fanatic, but simply gentle Shakespeare discovering to us his own sad heart
      and the sweetness which suffering had called forth in him.

      CHAPTER VII. DRAMAS OF REVENGE AND JEALOUSY: HAMLET.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful, pure and most moral nature, without the strength of nerve
      which makes the hero, sinks beneath a burden which it can neither bear nor
      throw off; every duty is holy to him,&mdash;this too hard. The impossible
      is required of him,&mdash;not the impossible in itself, but the impossible
      to him. How he winds, turns, agonizes, advances and recoils, ever
      reminded, ever reminding himself, and at last almost loses his purpose
      from his thoughts, without ever again recovering his peace of mind....&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Hamlet</i>&rdquo;
       by <i>Goethe</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goethe's criticism of Hamlet is so much finer than any English criticism
      that I am glad to quote it. It will serve, I think, as a standard to
      distinguish the best criticism of the past from what I shall set forth in
      the course of this analysis. In this chapter I shall try to show what new
      light our knowledge of Shakespeare throws on the play, and conversely what
      new light the play throws on its maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first moment of disillusion brought out, as we have seen in Brutus,
      all the kindness in Shakespeare's nature. He will believe in men in spite
      of experience; but the idealistic pose could not be kept up: sooner or
      later Shakespeare had to face the fact that he had been befooled and
      scorned by friend and mistress&mdash;how did he meet it? Hamlet is the
      answer: Shakespeare went about nursing dreams of revenge and murder.
      Disillusion had deeper consequences; forced to see other men as they were,
      he tried for a moment to see himself as he was. The outcome of that
      objective vision was Hamlet&mdash;a masterpiece of self-revealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, when he wrote &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; nothing was clear to him; the significance of
      the catastrophe had only dawned upon him; he had no notion how complete
      his soul-shipwreck was, still less did he dream of painting himself
      realistically in all his obsequious flunkeyism and ungovernable
      sensuality. He saw himself less idealistically than heretofore, and,
      trying to look at himself fairly, honestly, he could not but accuse
      himself of irresolution at the very least; he had hung on with Herbert, as
      the sonnets tell us, hoping to build again the confidence which had been
      ruined by betrayal, hoping he knew not what of gain or place, to the
      injury of his own self-respect; while brooding all the time on quite
      impossible plans of revenge, impossible, for action had been &ldquo;sicklied
      o'er with the pale cast of thought.&rdquo; Hamlet could not screw his courage to
      the sticking point, and so became a type for ever of the philosopher or
      man of letters who, by thinking, has lost the capacity for action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting ourselves in Shakespeare's place for the moment we see at once why
      he selected this story for treatment at this time. He knew, none better,
      that no young aristocrat would have submitted patiently to the wrong he
      had suffered from Lord Herbert; he created Laertes to show how instant and
      determined such a man would be in taking murderous revenge; but he still
      felt that what others would regard as faults, his irresolution and
      shrinking from bloodshed were in themselves nobler, and so, whilst half
      excusing, half realizing himself, he brought forth a masterpiece. This
      brooding on revenge, which is the heart and explanation of his great play,
      shows us how little Shakespeare cared for Herbert, how completely he had
      condemned him. The soliloquy on this point in &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; is the most
      characteristic thing in the drama:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;This is most brave,
  That I, the son of a dear father murder'd
  Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
  Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
  And fall a-cursing like a very drab.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare is thinking of Herbert's betrayal; &ldquo;here I am,&rdquo; he says,
      &ldquo;prompted to revenge by reason and custom, yet instead of acting I fall
      a-cursing like a drab.&rdquo; But behind his irresolution is his hatred of
      bloodshed: he could whip out his sword and on a sudden kill Polonius,
      mistaking him for the king (Herbert), but he could not, in cold blood,
      make up his mind to kill and proceed to execution. Like his own Hubert,
      Shakespeare had to confess:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Within this bosom never enter'd yet
  The dreadful motion of a murderous thought.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He had none of the direct, passionate, conscienceless resolution of
      Laertes. He whips himself to anger against the king by thinking of Herbert
      in the king's place; but lackey-like has to admit that mere regard for
      position and power gives him pause: Lord Herbert was too far above him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
  That treason can but peep to what it would.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's personal feeling dominates and inspires the whole play. One
      crucial instance will prove this. Why did Hamlet hate his mother's
      lechery? Most men would hardly have condemned it, certainly would not have
      suffered their thoughts to dwell on it beyond the moment; but to Hamlet
      his mother's faithlessness was horrible, shameful, degrading, simply
      because Hamlet-Shakespeare had identified her with Miss Fitton, and it was
      Miss Fitton's faithlessness, it was her deception he was condemning in the
      bitterest words he could find. He thus gets into a somewhat unreal
      tragedy, a passionate intensity which is otherwise wholly inexplicable.
      This is how he talks to his mother:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                 &ldquo;Have you eyes?
  Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
  And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes ...
  ...      ...      ...    What devil was't
  That thus cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
  Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
  Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
  Or but a sickly part of one true sense
  Could not so mope.
  O, shame! where is thy blush?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      If anyone can imagine that this is the way a son thinks of a mother's slip
      he is past my persuading. In all this Shakespeare is thinking of himself
      in comparison with Herbert; and his advice to his mother is almost as
      self-revealing, showing, as it does, what he would wish to say to Miss
      Fitton:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
  And do not spread the compost on the weeds
  To make them ranker....
  Assume a virtue if you have it not....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In his description of the king and queen we get Shakespeare's view of Lord
      Herbert and Miss Fitton: the king (Herbert) is &ldquo;mildew'd&rdquo; and foul in
      comparison with his modest poet-rival&mdash;&ldquo;A satyr to Hyperion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet's view of his mother (Miss Fitton), though bitterer still, is yet
      the bitterness of disappointed love: he will have her repent, refrain from
      the adultery, and be pure and good again. When the Queen asks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hamlet answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
  Let the king tempt you again to bed;
  Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
  And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
  Or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Maddened with jealousy he sees the act, scourges himself with his own lewd
      imagining as Posthumus scourges himself. No one ever felt this intensity
      of jealous rage about a mother or a sister. The mere idea is absurd; it is
      one's own passion-torture that speaks in such words as I have here quoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet's treatment of Ophelia, too, and his advice to her are all the
      outcome of Shakespeare's own disappointment:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
  breeder of sinners?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      We all expect from Hamlet some outburst of divine tenderness to Ophelia;
      but the scenes with the pure and devoted girl whom he is supposed to love
      are not half realized, are nothing like so intense as the scenes with the
      guilty mother. It is jealousy that is blazing in Shakespeare at this time,
      and not love; when Hamlet speaks to the Queen we hear Shakespeare speaking
      to his own faithless, guilty love. Besides, Ophelia is not even realized;
      she is submissive affection, an abstraction, and not a character.
      Shakespeare did not take interest enough in her to give her flesh and
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's jealousy and excessive sensuality come to full light in the
      scene between Hamlet and Ophelia, when they are about to witness the play
      before the king: he persists in talking smut to her, which she pretends
      not to understand. The lewdness, we all feel, is out of place in &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo;
       horribly out of place when Hamlet is talking to Ophelia, but Shakespeare's
      sensuality has been stung to ecstasy by Miss Fitton's frailty, and he
      cannot but give it voice. As soon as Ophelia goes out of her mind she,
      too, becomes coarse&mdash;all of which is but a witness to Shakespeare's
      tortured animality. Yet Goethe can talk of Hamlet's &ldquo;pure and most moral
      nature.&rdquo; A goat is hardly less pure, though Hamlet was moral enough in the
      high sense of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are one or two minor questions still to be considered, and the chief
      of these is how far, even in this moment of disillusion, did our
      Shakespeare see himself as he was? Hamlet says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more
  offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
</pre>
    <p>
      imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such
      fellows as I do crawling between heaven and earth? We are arrant knaves,
      all; believe none of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this is mere rhetoric, and full of clever self-excusing. Hamlet is not
      very revengeful or very ambitious; he is weakly-irresolute, and
      excessively sensual, with all the faults that accompany these frailties.
      Even at this moment, when he must know that he is not very revengeful,
      that forgiveness were easier to him, Shakespeare will pose to himself, and
      call himself revengeful: he is such an idealist that he absolutely refuses
      to see himself as he is. In later dramas we shall find that he grows to
      deeper self-knowledge. Hamlet is but the half-way house to complete
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately we have each of us an infallible touchstone by which we can
      judge of our love of truth. Any of us, man or woman, would rather be
      accused of a mental than a physical shortcoming. Do we see our bodily
      imperfections as they are? Can we describe ourselves pitilessly with snub
      nose, or coarse beak, bandy legs or thin shanks; gross paunch or sedgy
      beard? Shakespeare in Hamlet can hardly bear even to suggest his physical
      imperfections. Hamlet lets out inadvertently that he was fat, but he will
      not say so openly. His mother says to Hamlet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;You are fat and scant of breath.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Many people, especially actors, have been so determined to see Hamlet as
      slight and student-like, that they have tried to criticize this phrase,
      and one of them, Mr. Beerbohm Tree, even in our day, went so far as to
      degrade the text to &ldquo;faint and scant of breath.&rdquo; But the fatness is there,
      and comes to view again in another phrase of Hamlet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt,
  Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      No thin man ever spoke of his flesh in that way. Shakespeare was probably
      small, too. We know that he used to play Adam in &ldquo;As You Like it,&rdquo; and in
      the play Orlando has to take Adam up and carry him off the stage, a thing
      no actor would attempt if the Adam had been a big man. Shakespeare was
      probably of middle height, or below it, and podgy. I always picture him to
      myself as very like Swinburne. Yet even in Hamlet he would make himself
      out to be a devil of a fellow: &ldquo;valiant Hamlet,&rdquo; a swordsman of the
      finest, a superb duellist, who can touch Laertes again and again, though
      lacking practice. At the last push of fate Shakespeare will pose and
      deceive himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curiously characteristic of Shakespeare that when Hamlet broods on
      retaliation he does not brood like a brave man, who gloats on challenging
      his enemy to a fair fight, and killing him by sheer force or resolution;
      his passion, his revenge, is almost that of an Italian bravo. Not once
      does Hamlet think of forcing the king (Herbert) to a duel; he goes about
      with ideas of assassination, and not of combat.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Now might I do it pat&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      he cries as he sees the king praying; and he does not do it because he
      would thus send the king's soul to Heaven&mdash;shrill wordy intensity to
      excuse want of nerve. Whenever we get under the skin, it is Shakespeare's
      femininity which startles us.
    </p>
    <p>
      One cannot leave this great picture of Hamlet-Shakespeare without noticing
      one curious fact, which throws a flood of light on the relations of
      literary art to life. Shakespeare, as we have seen, is boiling with
      jealous passion, brooding continually on murderous revenge, and so becomes
      conscious of his own irresolution. He dwells on this, and makes this
      irresolution the chief feature of Hamlet's character, and yet because he
      is writing about himself he manages to suggest so many other qualities,
      and such amiable and noble ones, that we are all in love with Hamlet, in
      spite of his irresolution, erotic mania and bloody thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In later dramas Shakespeare went on to deal with the deeper and more
      elemental things in his nature, with jealousy in &ldquo;Othello,&rdquo; and passionate
      desire in &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra&rdquo;; but he never, perhaps, did much better
      work than in this drama where he chooses to magnify a secondary and
      ancillary weakness into the chief defect of his whole being. The pathos of
      the drama is to be found in the fact that Shakespeare realizes he is
      unable to take personal vengeance on Herbert. &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; is a drama of
      pathetic weakness, strengthened by a drama of revenge and jealousy. In
      these last respects it is a preparatory study for &ldquo;Othello.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; Shakespeare let out some of the foul matter which Herbert's
      mean betrayal had bred in him. Even in &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; however, his passion for
      Mary Fitton, and his jealousy of her, constitute the real theme. We shall
      soon see how this passion coloured all the rest of his life and art, and
      at length brought about his ruin.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. DRAMAS OF REVENGE AND JEALOUSY: PART II &ldquo;OTHELLO&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      There is perhaps no single drama which throws such light on Shakespeare
      and his method of work as &ldquo;Othello&rdquo;: it is a long conflict between the
      artist in him and the man, and, in the struggle, both his artistic ideals
      and his passionate soul come to clearest view. From it we see that
      Shakespeare's nature gave itself gradually to jealousy and revenge. The
      fire of his passion burned more and more fiercely for years; was
      infinitely hotter in 1604, when &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; was written, than it had been
      when &ldquo;Julius Caesar&rdquo; was written in 1600. This proves to me that
      Shakespeare's connection with Mary Fitton did not come to an end when he
      first discovered her unfaithfulness. The intimacy continued for a dozen
      years. In Sonnet 136 he prays her to allow him to be one of her lovers.
      That she was liberal enough to consent appears clearly from the growth of
      passion in his plays. It is certain, too, that she went on deceiving him
      with other lovers, or his jealousy would have waned away, ebbing with
      fulfilled desire. But his passion increases in intensity from 1597 to
      1604, whipped no doubt to ecstasy by continual deception and wild
      jealousy. Both lust and jealousy swing to madness in &ldquo;Othello,&rdquo; But
      Shakespeare was so great an artist that, when he took the story from
      Cinthio, he tried to realize it without bringing in his own personality:
      hence a conflict between his art and his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first sight &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; reminds one of a picture by Titian or Veronese;
      it is a romantic conception; the personages are all in gala dress; the
      struggle between Iago and the Moor is melodramatic; the whole picture
      aglow with a superb richness of colour. It is Shakespeare's finest play,
      his supreme achievement as a playwright. It is impossible to read
      &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; without admiring the art of it. The beginning is so easy: the
      introduction of the chief characters so measured and impressive that when
      the action really begins, it develops and increases in speed as by its own
      weight to the inevitable end; inevitable&mdash;for the end in this case is
      merely the resultant of the shock of these various personalities. But if
      the action itself is superbly ordered, the painting of character leaves
      much to be desired, as we shall see. There is one notable difference
      between &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; and those dramas, &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo;
       wherein Shakespeare has depicted himself as the protagonist. In the
      self-revealing dramas not only does Shakespeare give his hero licence to
      talk, in and out of season, and thus hinder the development of the story,
      but he also allows him to occupy the whole stage without a competitor. The
      explanation is obvious enough. Dramatic art is to be congratulated on the
      fact that now and then Shakespeare left himself for a little out of the
      play, for then not only does the construction of the play improve, but the
      play grows in interest through the encounter of evenly-matched
      antagonists. The first thing we notice in &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; is that Iago is at
      least as important a character as the hero himself. &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; on the other
      hand, is almost a lyric; there is no counterpoise to the student-prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us get to the play itself. Othello's first appearance in converse
      with Iago in the second scene of the first act does not seem to me to
      deserve the praise that has been lavished on it. Though Othello knows that
      &ldquo;boasting is (not) an honour,&rdquo; he nevertheless boasts himself of royal
      blood. We have noticed already Shakespeare's love of good blood, and
      belief in its wondrous efficacy; it is one of his permanent and most
      characteristic traits. The passage about royal descent might be left out
      with advantage; if these three lines are omitted, Othello's pride in his
      own nature&mdash;his &ldquo;parts and perfect soul&rdquo;&mdash;is far more strongly
      felt. But such trivial flaws are forgotten when Brabantio enters and
      swords are drawn.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      is excellent in its contemptuous irony. A little later, however, Othello
      finds an expression which is intensely characteristic of a great man of
      action:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Hold your hands,
  Both you of my inclining, and the rest;
  Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
  Without a prompter.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This last line and a half is addressed especially to Iago who is bent on
      provoking a fight, and is, I think, the best piece of character-painting
      in all &ldquo;Othello&rdquo;; the born general knows instinctively the moment to
      attack just as the trained boxer's hand strikes before he consciously sees
      the opening. When Othello speaks before the Duke, too, he reveals himself
      with admirable clearness and truth to nature. His pride is so deep-rooted,
      his self-respect so great, that he respects all other dignitaries: the
      Senators are his &ldquo;very noble and approved good masters.&rdquo; Every word
      weighed and effectual. Admirable, too, is the expression &ldquo;round
      unvarnished tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But pride and respect for others' greatness are not qualities peculiar to
      the man of action; they belong to all men of ability. As soon as Othello
      begins to tell how he won Desdemona, he falls out of his character.
      Feeling certain that he has placed his hero before us in strong outlines,
      Shakespeare lets himself go, and at once we catch him speaking and not
      Othello. In &ldquo;antres vast and deserts idle&rdquo; I hear the poet, and when the
      verse swings to&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     &ldquo;.... men whose heads
  Do grow beneath their shoulders,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      it is plain that Othello, the lord and lover of realities, has deserted
      the firm ground of fact. But Shakespeare pulls himself in almost before he
      has yielded to the charm of his own words, and again Othello speaks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                           &ldquo;This to hear
  Would Desdemona seriously incline,
  But still the house-affairs would draw her thence,
</pre>
    <p>
      and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temptation, however, was overpowering, and again Shakespeare yields to
      it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And often did beguile her of her tears
  When I did speak of some distressful stroke
  That my youth suffered.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is a characteristic of the man of action that he thinks lightly of
      reverses; he loves hard buffets as a swimmer high waves, and when he tells
      his life-story he does not talk of his &ldquo;distress.&rdquo; This &ldquo;distressful
      stroke that my youth suffered&rdquo; is manifestly pure Shakespeare&mdash;tender-hearted
      Shakespeare, who pitied himself and the distressful strokes his youth
      suffered very profoundly. The characterization of Othello in the rest of
      this scene is anything but happy. He talks too much; I miss the short
      sharp words which would show the man used to command, and not only does he
      talk too much, but he talks in images like a poet, and exaggerates:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The tyrant Custom, most grave senators,
  Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
  My thrice-driven bed of down.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Even the matter here is insincere; this is the poet's explanation of the
      Captain's preference for a hard bed and hard living: &ldquo;has been accustomed
      to it,&rdquo; says Shakespeare, not understanding that there are born hunter and
      soldier natures who absolutely prefer hardships to effeminate luxury.
      Othello's next speech is just as bad; he talks too much of things
      particular and private, and the farther he goes, the worse he gets, till
      we again hear the poet speaking, or rather mouthing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;No, when light-winged toys
  Of feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness
  My speculative and officed instruments,
  That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
  Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
  And all indign and base adversities
  Make head against my estimation.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again when he says&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
  Of love, of worldly matters and direction
  To spend with thee; we must obey the time,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I find no sharp impatience to get to work such as Hotspur felt, but a
      certain reluctance to leave his love&mdash;a natural touch which indicates
      that the poet was thinking of himself and not of his puppet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first scene of the second act shows us how Shakespeare, the dramatist,
      worked. Cassio is plainly Shakespeare the poet; any of his speeches taken
      at haphazard proves it. When he hears that Iago has arrived he breaks out:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;He has had most favourable and happy speed;
  Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
  The guttered rocks and congregated sands&mdash;
  Traitors ensteeped to clog the guiltless keel&mdash;
  As having sense of beauty, do omit
  Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
  The divine Desdemona.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And when Desdemona lands, Cassio's first exclamation is sufficient to
      establish the fact that he is merely the poet's mask:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                               &ldquo;O, behold,
  The riches of the ship is come on shore!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And just as clearly as Cassio is Shakespeare, the lyric poet, so is Iago,
      at first, the embodiment of Shakespeare's intelligence. Iago has been
      described as immoral; he does not seem to me to be immoral, but amoral, as
      the intellect always is. He says to the women:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Come on, come on; you're pictures out of doors,
  Bells in your parlours, wild cats in your kitchens,
  Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,
  Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your
  beds.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Iago sees things as they are, fairly and not maliciously; he is &ldquo;nothing
      if not critical,&rdquo; but his criticism has a touch of Shakespeare's erotic
      mania in it. Think of that &ldquo;housewives in your beds&rdquo;! He will not deceive
      himself, however; in spite of Cassio's admiration of Desdemona Iago does
      not imagine that Cassio is in love with her; &ldquo;well kissed,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;an
      excellent courtesy,&rdquo; finding at once the true explanation. {Footnote: At
      the end of this scene Iago says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;That Cassio loves her I do well believe it,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      but that is merely one of the many inconsistencies in Shakespeare's
      drawing of Iago. There are others; at one time he talks of Cassio as a
      mere book soldier, at another equals him with Cæsar. Had Coleridge noted
      these contradictions he would have declared them to be a higher perfection
      than logical unity, and there is something to be said for the argument,
      though in these instances I think the contradictions are due to
      Shakespeare's carelessness rather than to his deeper insight.}
    </p>
    <p>
      But having taken up this intellectual attitude in order to create Iago,
      Shakespeare tries next to make his puppet concrete and individual by
      giving him revenge for a soul, but in this he does not succeed, for
      intellect is not maleficent. At moments Iago lives for us; &ldquo;drown cats and
      blind puppies ... put money in your purse&rdquo;&mdash;his brains delight us;
      but when he pursues Desdemona to her end, we revolt; such malignity is
      inhuman. Shakespeare was so little inclined to evil, knew so little of
      hate and revenge that his villain is unreal in his cruelty. Again and
      again the reader asks himself why Iago is so venomous. He hates Othello
      because Othello has passed him over and preferred Cassio; because he
      thinks he has had reason to be jealous of Othello, because&mdash;&mdash;-but
      every one feels that these are reasons supplied by Shakespeare to explain
      the inexplicable; taken all together they are inadequate, and we are apt
      to throw them aside with Coleridge as the &ldquo;motive hunting of motiveless
      malignity.&rdquo; But such a thing as &ldquo;motiveless malignity&rdquo; is not in nature,
      Iago's villainy is too cruel, too steadfast to be human; perfect pitiless
      malignity is as impossible to man as perfect innate goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Iago and Othello hold the stage for nine-tenths of the play
      Shakespeare does not realize them so completely as he realizes Cassio, an
      altogether subordinate character. The drinking episode of Cassio was not
      found by Shakespeare in Cinthio, and is, I think, clearly the confession
      of Shakespeare himself, for though aptly invented to explain Cassio's
      dismissal it is unduly prolonged, and thus constitutes perhaps the most
      important fault in the construction of the play. Consider, too, how the
      moral is applied by Iago to England in especial, with which country
      neither Iago nor the story has anything whatever to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Othello's appearance stilling the riot, his words to Iago and his
      dismissal of Cassio are alike honest work. The subsequent talk between
      Cassio and Iago about &ldquo;reputation&rdquo; is scarcely more than a repetition of
      what Falstaff said of &ldquo;honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coleridge has made a great deal of the notion that Othello was justified
      in describing himself as &ldquo;not easily jealous&rdquo;; but poor Coleridge's
      perverse ingenuity never led him further astray. The exact contrary must,
      I think, be admitted; Othello was surely very quick to suspect Desdemona;
      he remembers Iago's first suspicious phrase, ponders it and asks its
      meaning; he is as quick as Posthumus was to believe the worst of Imogen,
      as quick as Richard II. to suspect his friends Bagot and Green of
      traitorism, and this proneness to suspicion is the soul of jealousy. And
      Othello is not only quick to suspect but easy to convince&mdash;impulsive
      at once and credulous. His quick wits jump to the conclusion that Iago,
      &ldquo;this honest creature!&rdquo; doubtless
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      On hinted imputation he is already half persuaded, and persuaded as only a
      sensualist would be that it is lust which has led Desdemona astray:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;O curse of marriage!
  That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
  And not their appetites.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He is, indeed, so disposed to catch the foul infection that Iago cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Trifles light as air
  Are to the jealous confirmations strong
  As proofs of holy writ.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And well he may, for before he uses the handkerchief or any evidence, on
      mere suspicion Othello is already racked with doubt, distraught with
      jealousy, maddened with passion; &ldquo;his occupation's gone&rdquo;; he rages against
      Iago and demands proof, Iago answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                   &ldquo;I do not like the office;
  But, sith I am entered in this cause so far
       - -     - -     - -     - -     - -     - -
  I will go on.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is the same paltry reason Richard III. and Macbeth adduced for adding
      to the number of their crimes, the truth being that Shakespeare could find
      no reason in his own nature for effective hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Othello gives immediate credence to Iago's dream, thinks it &ldquo;a shrewd
      doubt&rdquo;; he is a &ldquo;credulous fool,&rdquo; as Iago calls him, and it is only our
      sense of Iago's devilish cleverness that allows us to excuse Othello's
      folly. The strawberry-spotted handkerchief is not needed: the magic in its
      web is so strong that the mere mention of it blows his love away and
      condemns both Cassio and Desdemona to death. If this Othello is not easily
      jealous then no man is prone to doubt and quick to turn from love to
      loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth of the matter is that in the beginning of the play Othello is a
      marionette fairly well shaped and exceedingly picturesque; but as soon as
      jealousy is touched upon, the mask is thrown aside; Othello, the
      self-contained captain, disappears, the poet takes his place and at once
      shows himself to be the aptest subject for the green fever. The emotions
      then put into Othello's mouth are intensely realized; his jealousy is
      indeed Shakespeare's own confession, and it would be impossible to find in
      all literature pages of more sincere and terrible self-revealing.
      Shakespeare is not more at home in showing us the passion of Romeo and
      Juliet or the irresolution of Richard II. or the scepticism of Hamlet than
      in depicting the growth and paroxysms of jealousy; his overpowering
      sensuality, the sensuality of Romeo and of Orsino, has sounded every note
      of love's mortal sickness:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;<i>Oth.</i> I had been happy if the general camp,
  Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body,
  So I had nothing known.
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
We have here the proof that the jealousy of Othello was Shakespeare's
jealousy; it is all compounded of sensuality. But, and this is the
immediate point of my argument, the captain, Othello, is not presented
to us as a sensualist to whom such a suspicion would be, of course, the
nearest thought. On the contrary, Othello is depicted as sober
{Footnote: Shakespeare makes Lodovico speak of Othello's &ldquo;solid
virtue&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the nature whom passion could not shake.&rdquo; Even Iago finds
Othello's anger ominous because of its rarity:

  &ldquo;There's matter in't, indeed, if he be angry."}
and solid, slow to anger, and master of himself and his desires; he
expressly tells the lords of Venice that he does not wish Desdemona to
accompany him:

  &ldquo;To please the palate of my appetite
  Nor to comply with heat&mdash;the young affects,
  In me defunct&mdash;and proper satisfaction.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare goes out of his way to put this unnecessary explanation in
      Othello's mouth; he will not have us think of him as passion's fool, but
      as passion's master; Othello is not to be even suspicious; he tells Iago:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                       &ldquo;'Tis not to make me jealous
  To say&mdash;my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
  Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
  Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
  Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
  The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
  For she had eyes and chose me.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was all this, no doubt, that misled Coleridge. He did not realize that
      this Othello suddenly changes his nature; the sober lord of himself
      becomes in an instant very quick to suspect, and being jealous, is nothing
      if not sensual; he can think of no reason for Desdemona's fall but her
      appetite; the imagination of the sensual act throws him into a fit; it is
      this picture which gives life to his hate. The conclusion is not to be
      avoided; as soon as Othello becomes jealous he is transformed by
      Shakespeare's own passion. For this is the way Shakespeare conceived
      jealousy and the only way. The jealousy of Leontes in &ldquo;The Winter's Tale&rdquo;
       is precisely the same; Hermione gives her hand to Polixenes, and at once
      Leontes suspects and hates, and his rage is all of &ldquo;paddling palms {1} and
      pinching fingers.&rdquo; The jealousy of Posthumus, too, is of the same kind:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      &ldquo;Never talk on 't;
  She hath been colted by him.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      {Footnote 1: Iago's expression, too; cf. &ldquo;Othello,&rdquo; II. 1, and &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo;
       III. 4.}
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the imagining of the sensual act that drives him to incoherence and
      the verge of madness, as it drove Othello. In all these characters
      Shakespeare is only recalling the stages of the passion that desolated his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The part that imagination usually plays in tormenting the jealous man with
      obscene pictures is now played by Iago; the first scene of the fourth act
      is this erotic self-torture put in Iago's mouth. As Othello's passion
      rises to madness, as the self-analysis becomes more and more intimate and
      personal, we have Shakespeare's re-lived agony clothing itself in his
      favourite terms of expression:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    &ldquo;O! it comes o'er my memory,
  As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
  Boding to all,&mdash;he had my handkerchief.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The interest swings still higher; the scene in which Iago uses Cassio's
      conceit and laughter to exasperate further the already mad Othello is one
      of the notable triumphs of dramatic art. But just as the quick growth of
      his jealousy, and its terrible sensuality, have shown us that Othello is
      not the self-contained master of his passions that he pretends to be and
      that Shakespeare wishes us to believe, so this scene, in which the
      listening Othello rages in savagery, reveals to us an intense femininity
      of nature. For generally the man concentrates his hatred upon the woman
      who deceives him, and is only disdainful of his rival, whereas the woman
      for various reasons gives herself to hatred of her rival, and feels only
      angry contempt for her lover's traitorism. But Othello&mdash;or shall we
      not say Shakespeare?&mdash;discovers in the sincerest ecstasy of this
      passion as much of the woman's nature as of the man's. After seeing his
      handkerchief in Bianca's hands he asks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;How shall I murder him, Iago?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Manifestly, Shakespeare is thinking of Herbert and his base betrayal.
      Othello would have Cassio thrown to the dogs, would have him &ldquo;nine years
      a-killing&rdquo;; and though he adds that Desdemona shall &ldquo;rot and perish and be
      damned to-night,&rdquo; immediately afterwards we see what an infinite affection
      for her underlies his anger:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, the world hath not a sweeter creature: she might
  lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then Shakespeare uses his brains objectively, so to speak, to excuse
      his persistent tenderness, and at once he reveals himself and proves to us
      that he is thinking of Mary Fitton, and not of poor Desdemona:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang her! I do but say what she is.&mdash;So delicate with her needle!&mdash;An
      admirable musician! O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear.&mdash;Of
      so high and plenteous wit and invention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare himself speaks in this passage. For when has Desdemona shown
      high and plenteous wit or invention? She is hardly more than a symbol of
      constancy. It is Mary Fitton who has &ldquo;wit and invention,&rdquo; and is &ldquo;an
      admirable musician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The feminine tenderness in Shakespeare comes to perfect expression in the
      next lines; no woman has a more enduring affection:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Iago</i>. She's the worse for all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Oth</i>. O! a thousand, a thousand times. And, then of so gentle a
      condition!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Iago</i>. Ay, too gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Oth</i>. Nay, that's certain:&mdash;but yet the pity of it, Iago!&mdash;O,
      Iago, the pity of it, Iago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tenderness shrills to such exquisite poignancy that it becomes a
      universal cry, the soul's lament for traitorism: &ldquo;The pity of it, Iago! O,
      Iago, the pity of it!&rdquo; Othello's jealous passion is at its height in the
      scene with Desdemona when he gives his accusations precise words, and
      flings money to Emilia as the guilty confidante. And yet even here, where
      he delights to soil his love, his tenderness reaches its most passionate
      expression:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;O thou weed,
  Who art so lovely fair, and smell'st so sweet,
  That the sense aches at thee&mdash;would thou hadst ne'er
    been born!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As soon as jealousy reaches its end, and passes into revenge, Shakespeare
      tries to get back into Othello the captain again. Othello's first speech
      in the bedchamber is clear enough in all conscience, but it has been so
      mangled by unintelligent actors such as Salvini that it cries for
      explanation. Every one will remember how Salvini and others playing this
      part stole into the room like murderers, and then bellowed so that they
      would have waked the dead. And when the foolish mummers were criticised
      for thus misreading the character, they answered boldly that Othello was a
      Moor, that his passion was Southern, and I know not what besides. It is
      clear that Shakespeare's Othello enters the room quietly as a justicer
      with a duty to perform: he keeps his resolution to the sticking-point by
      thinking of the offence; he says solemnly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and, Englishman-like, finds a moral reason for his intended action:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But the reason fades and the resolution wavers in the passion for her
      &ldquo;body and beauty,&rdquo; and the tenderness of the lover comes to hearing again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;{<i>Kissing her</i>."} O balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
  Justice to break her sword!&mdash;one more, one more.&mdash;
  Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
  And love thee after.&mdash;One more, and this the last.
  So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
  But they are cruel tears; this sorrow's heavenly;
  It strikes where it doth love.&mdash;She wakes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So gentle a murderer was never seen save Macbeth, and the &ldquo;heavenly
      sorrow&rdquo; that strikes where it doth love is one of the best examples in
      literature of the Englishman's capacity for hypocritical self-deception.
      The subsequent dialogue shows us in Othello the short, plain phrases of
      immitigable resolution; in this scene Shakespeare comes nearer to
      realizing strength than anywhere else in all his work. But even here his
      nature shows itself; Othello has to be misled by Desdemona's weeping,
      which he takes to be sorrow for Cassio's death, before he can pass to
      action, and as soon as the murder is accomplished, he regrets:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, insupportable! O heavy hour!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      His frank avowal, however, is excellently characteristic of the soldier
      Othello:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;'Twas I that killed her.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A moment later there is a perfect poetic expression of his love:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 &ldquo;Nay, had she been true
  If Heaven would make me such another world
  Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,
  I'd not have sold her for it.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then comes a revelation of sensuality and physical fastidiousness so
      peculiar that by itself it proves much of what I have said of Shakespeare:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Oth</i>. ... Ay 'twas he that told me first;
  An honest man he is, and hates the slime
  That sticks on filthy deeds.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      For a breathing-space now before he is convinced of his fatal error,
      Othello speaks as the soldier, but in spite of the fact that he has
      fulfilled his revenge, and should be at his sincerest, we have no word of
      profound self-revealing. But as soon as he realizes his mistake, his
      regret becomes as passionate as a woman's and magical in expression:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Cold, cold, my girl!
  Even like thy chastity.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Another proof that Shakespeare discards the captain, Othello, in order to
      give utterance to his own jealousy and love, is to be found in the
      similarity between this speech of Othello and the corresponding speech of
      Posthumus in &ldquo;Cymbeline.&rdquo; As soon as Posthumus is convinced of his
      mistake, he calls Iachimo &ldquo;Italian fiend&rdquo; and himself &ldquo;most credulous
      fool,&rdquo; &ldquo;egregious murderer,&rdquo; and so forth. He asks for &ldquo;some upright
      justicer&rdquo; to punish him as he deserves with &ldquo;cord or knife or poison,&rdquo;
       nay, he will have &ldquo;torturers ingenious.&rdquo; He then praises Imogen as &ldquo;the
      temple of virtue,&rdquo; and again shouts curses at himself and finally calls
      upon his love:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;O Imogen!
  My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
  Imogen, Imogen!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Othello behaves in precisely the same manner; he calls Iago that
      &ldquo;demi-devil,&rdquo; and himself &ldquo;an honourable murderer&rdquo;; and Iago calls him a
      &ldquo;credulous fool.&rdquo; Othello, too, cries for punishment; instead of
      &ldquo;torturers ingenious,&rdquo; he will have &ldquo;devils&rdquo; to &ldquo;whip&rdquo; him, and &ldquo;roast him
      in sulphur.&rdquo; He praises Desdemona as chaste, &ldquo;ill-starred wench,&rdquo; &ldquo;my
      girl,&rdquo; and so forth; then curses himself lustily and ends his lament with
      the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O Desdemon! dead, Desdemon! dead! O!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The same changes in mood, the same words even&mdash;the likeness is so
      close that it can only be explained as I have explained it; from beginning
      to end of &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo; Posthumus is Shakespeare, and as soon as jealousy,
      pity, remorse, or any tender emotion seizes Othello he becomes Shakespeare
      too, and speaks with Shakespeare's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      From here on, it is all good work if not great work to Othello's last
      speech, which merits particular consideration. He begins as the captain,
      but soon passes into the poet; and then towards the end talks again in
      quick measure as the man of action. I quote the whole speech, {Footnote:
      This speech is curiously like the long speech of Richard II. which I have
      already noticed; at the beginning Shakespeare speaks as a king for a few
      lines, then naturally as a poet, and at the end pulls himself up and tries
      to resume the character.} putting into italics the phrases in which the
      poet betrays himself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Oth</i>. Soft you; a word or two, before you go.
  I have done the State some service, and they know it;
  No more of that.&mdash;<i>I pray you</i> in your letters,
  When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
  Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
  Nor set down aught in malice; then must you speak
  <i>Of one that loved not wisely, but too well;
  Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
  Perplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand,
  Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
  Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
  Albeit unuséd to the melting mood,
  Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
  Their medicinal gum.</i> Set you down this;
  And say, besides, that in Aleppo once,
  When a malignant and a turban'd Turk
  Beat a Venetian, and traduced the State,
  I took by the throat the circumcized dog
  And smote him&mdash;thus.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All the memorable words here are the words of the gentle poet revealing
      his own nature ingenuously. The relief given by tears is exquisitely
      expressed, but the relief itself is a feminine experience; men usually
      find that tears humiliate them, and take refuge from their scalding shame
      in anger. The deathless phrases of the poet's grief must be contrasted
      with the braggart mouthings of the captain at the end in order to realize
      how impossible it was for Shakespeare to depict a man of deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first two acts Shakespeare has tried to present Othello with some
      sincerity and truth to the dramatic fiction. But as soon as jealousy
      touches Othello, he becomes the transparent vessel of Shakespeare's own
      emotion, and is filled with it as with his heart's blood. All the magical
      phrases in the play are phrases of jealousy, passion, and pity. The
      character of the captain in Othello is never deeply realized. It is a
      brave sketch, but, after all, only the merest sketch when compared with
      Hamlet or Macbeth. We know what they thought of life and death, and of all
      things in the world and over it; but what do we know of Othello's thoughts
      upon the deepest matters that concern man? Did he believe even in his
      stories to Desdemona?&mdash;in the men whose heads do grow beneath their
      shoulders? in his magic handkerchief? in what Iago calls his &ldquo;fantastical
      lies&rdquo;? This, I submit, is another important indication that Shakespeare
      drew Othello, the captain, from the outside; the jealous, tender heart of
      him is Shakespeare's, but take that away and we scarcely know more of him
      than the colour of his skin. What interests us in Othello is not his
      strength, but his weakness, Shakespeare's weakness&mdash;his passion and
      pity, his torture, rage, jealousy and remorse, the successive stages of
      his soul's Calvary!

      CHAPTER IX. DRAMAS OF LUST: PART I. <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                &ldquo;He probed from hell to hell
  Of human passions, but of love deflowered
  His wisdom was not....&rdquo;
   &mdash;<i>Meredith's Sonnet on Shakespeare</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      With &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and his dreams of an impossible revenge Shakespeare got rid
      of some of the perilous stuff which his friend's traitorism had bred in
      him. In &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; he gave deathless expression to the madness of his
      jealous rage and so cleared his soul, to some extent, of that poisonous
      infection. But passion in Shakespeare survived hatred of the betrayer and
      jealousy of him; he had quickly finished with Herbert; but Mary Fitton
      lived still for him and tempted him perpetually&mdash;the lust of the
      flesh, the desire of the eye, insatiable, cruel as the grave. He will now
      portray his mistress for us dramatically&mdash;unveil her very soul, show
      the gipsy-wanton as she is. He who has always painted in high lights is
      now going to paint French fashion, in blackest shadows, for with the years
      his passion and his bitterness have grown in intensity. Mary Fitton is now
      &ldquo;false Cressid.&rdquo; Pandarus says of her in the first scene of the first act:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's&mdash;well,
  go to&mdash;there were no more comparison between
  the women.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mary Fitton's hair, we know, was raven-black, but the evidence connecting
      Shakespeare's mistress with &ldquo;false Cressid&rdquo; is stronger, as we shall see,
      than any particular line or expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo; is a wretched, invertebrate play without even a
      main current of interest. Of course there are fine phrases in it, as in
      most of the productions of Shakespeare's maturity; but the
      characterization is worse than careless, and at first one wonders why
      Shakespeare wrote the tedious, foolish stuff except to get rid of his own
      bitterness in the railing of Thersites, and in the depicting of Cressida's
      shameless wantonness. It is impossible to doubt that &ldquo;false Cressid&rdquo; was
      meant for Mary Fitton. The moment she appears the play begins to live;
      personal bitterness turns her portrait into a caricature; every fault is
      exaggerated and lashed with rage; it is not so much a drama as a scene
      where Shakespeare insults his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us look at this phase of his passion in perspective. Almost as soon as
      he became acquainted with Miss Fitton, about Christmas 1597, Shakespeare
      wrote of her as a wanton; yet so long as she gave herself to him he
      appears to have been able to take refuge in his tenderness and endure her
      strayings. But passion in him grew with what it fed on, and after she
      faulted with Lord Herbert, we find him in a sonnet threatening her that
      his &ldquo;pity-wanting pain&rdquo; may induce him to write of her as she was. No
      doubt her pride and scornful strength revolted under this treatment and
      she drew away from him. Tortured by desire he would then praise her with
      some astonishing phrases; call her &ldquo;the heart's blood of beauty, love's
      invisible soul,&rdquo; and after some hesitation she would yield again. No
      sooner was the &ldquo;ruined love&rdquo; rebuilt than she would offend again, and
      again he would curse and threaten, and so the wretched, half-miserable,
      half-ecstatic life of passion stormed along, one moment in Heaven, the
      next in Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the while Shakespeare was longing, or thought he was longing for truth
      and constancy, and at length he gave form and name to his desire for
      winnowed purity of love and perfect constancy, and this consoling but
      impalpable ideal he called Ophelia, Desdemona, Cordelia. But again and
      again Miss Fitton reconquered him and at length his accumulated bitterness
      compelled him to depict his mistress realistically. Cressida is his first
      attempt, the first dramatic portrait of the mistress who got into
      Shakespeare's blood and infected the current of his being, and the
      portrait is spoiled by the poet's hatred and contempt just as the whole
      drama is spoiled by a passion of bitterness that is surely the sign of
      intense personal suffering. Cressida is depicted as a vile wanton, a drab
      by nature; but it is no part even of this conception to make her soulless
      and devilish. On the contrary, an artist of Shakespeare's imaginative
      sympathy loves to put in high relief the grain of good in things evil and
      the taint of evil in things good that give humanity its curious
      complexity. Shakespeare observed this rule of dramatic presentation more
      consistently than any of his predecessors or contemporaries&mdash;more
      consistently, more finely far than Homer or Sophocles, whose heroes had
      only such faults as their creators thought virtues; why then did he forget
      nature so far as to picture &ldquo;false Cressida&rdquo; without a redeeming quality?
      He first shows her coquetting with Troilus, and her coquetry even is
      unattractive, shallow, and obvious; then she gives herself to Troilus out
      of passionate desire; but Shakespeare omits to tell us why she takes up
      with Diomedes immediately afterwards. We are to understand merely that she
      is what Ulysses calls a &ldquo;sluttish spoil of opportunity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;daughter of
      the game.&rdquo; But as passionate desire is not of necessity faithless we are
      distressed and puzzled by her soulless wantonness. And when she goes on to
      present Diomedes with the scarf that Troilus gave her, we revolt; the
      woman is too full of blood to be so entirely heartless. Here is the scene
      embittered by the fact that Troilus witnesses Cressida's betrayal:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Diomedes.</i> I had your heart before, this follows it.

  <i>Troilus.</i> {<i>Aside.</i>} I did swear patience.

  <i>Cressida.</i> You shall not have it, Diomed, faith you shall not;
  I'll give you something else.

  <i>Diomedes.</i> I will have this: whose was it?

  <i>Cressida.</i> It is no matter.

  <i>Diomedes.</i> Come, tell me whose it was?

  <i>Cressida</i>. 'Twas one that loved me better than you will,
  But, now you have it, take it.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The scene is a splendid dramatic scene, a piece torn from life, so
      realistic that it convinces, and yet we revolt; we feel that we have not
      got to the heart of the mystery. There is so much evil in Cressida that we
      want to see the spark of goodness in her, however fleeting and ineffective
      the spark may be. But Shakespeare makes her attempt at justification a
      confession of absolute faithlessness:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee,
  But with my heart the other eye doth see.
  Ah! poor our sex! This fault in us I find,
  The error of our eye directs our mind.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is plainly Shakespeare's reflection and not Cressida's apology, and
      if we contrast this speech with the dialogue given above, it becomes
      plain, I think, that the terrible scene with Diomedes is taken from life,
      or is at least Shakespeare's vision of the way Mary Fitton behaved.
      There's a magic in those devilish words of Cressida that outdoes
      imagination:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;'Twas one that loved me better than you will,
  But, now you have it, take it.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Sweet, honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly:&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The very power of the characterization makes the traitress hateful. If
      Mary Fitton ever gave any gift of Shakespeare to Lord Herbert, the
      dramatist should have known that she no longer loved him, had in reality
      already forgotten him in her new passion; but to paint a woman as
      remembering a lover, indeed as still loving him, and yet as giving his
      gift to another, is an offence in art though it may be true to nature. It
      is a fault in art because it is impossible to motive it in a few lines.
      The fact of the gift is bad enough; without explanation it is horrible.
      For this and other reasons I infer that Shakespeare took the fact from his
      own experience: he had suffered, it seems to me, from some such traitorism
      on the part of his mistress, or he ascribed to Mary Fitton some traitorism
      of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sonnet 122 he finds weighty excuse for having given away the table-book
      which his friend had given to him. His own confessed shortcoming might
      have taught him to exercise more lenient judgment towards his frail love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Shakespeare wrote &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo; a passion of bitterness
      possessed him; he not only vilified Cressida but all the world, Agamemnon,
      Nestor, Achilles, Ajax; he seems indeed to have taken more pleasure in the
      railing of Thersites than in any other part of the work except the
      scourging of Cressida. He shocks us by the picture of Achilles and his
      myrmidons murdering Hector when they come upon him unarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two incidental difficulties must be settled before we pass to a
      greater play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo; has always been regarded as a sort of enigma.
      Professor Dowden asks: &ldquo;With what intention and in what spirit did
      Shakespeare write this strange comedy? All the Greek heroes who fought
      against Troy are pitilessly exposed to ridicule?&rdquo; And from this fact and
      the bitterness of &ldquo;Timon&rdquo; some German critics have drawn the inference
      that Shakespeare was incapable of comprehending Greek life, and that
      indeed he only realized his Romans so perfectly because the Roman was very
      like the Briton in his mastery of practical affairs, of the details of
      administration and of government. This is an excellent instance of German
      prejudice. No one could have been better fitted than Shakespeare to
      understand Greek civilization and Greek art with its supreme love of
      plastic beauty, but his master Plutarch gave him far better pictures of
      Roman life than of Greek life, partly because Plutarch lived in the time
      of Roman domination and partly because he was in far closer sympathy with
      the masters of practical affairs than with artists in stone like Phidias
      or artists in thought like Plato. The true explanation of Shakespeare's
      caricatures of Greek life, whether Homeric or Athenian, is to be found in
      the fact that he was not only entirely ignorant of it but prejudiced
      against it. And this prejudice in him had an obvious root. Chapman had
      just translated and published the first books of his Iliad, and Chapman
      was the poet whom Shakespeare speaks of as his rival in Sonnets 78-86. He
      cannot help smiling at the &ldquo;strained touches&rdquo; of Chapman's rhetoric and
      his heavy learning. Those who care to remember the first scene of &ldquo;Love's
      Labour's Lost&rdquo; will recall how Shakespeare in that early work mocked at
      learning and derided study. When he first reached London he was no doubt
      despised for his ignorance of Greek and Latin; he had had to bear the
      sneers and flouts of the many who appraised learning, an university
      training and gentility above genius. He took the first opportunity of
      answering his critics:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Small have continual plodders ever won,
  Save bare authority from others' books.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But the taunts rankled, and when the bitter days came of disappointment
      and disillusion he took up that Greek life which his rival had tried to
      depict in its fairest colours, and showed what he thought was the seamy
      side of it. But had he known anything of Greek life and Greek art it would
      have been his pleasure to outdo his rival by giving at once a truer and a
      fairer presentation of Greece than Chapman could conceive. It is the
      rivalry of Chapman that irritates Shakespeare into pouring contempt on
      Greek life in &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida.&rdquo; As Chapman was for the Greeks,
      Shakespeare took sides with the Trojans.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why do I assume that &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo; is earlier than &ldquo;Antony
      and Cleopatra?&rdquo; Some critics, and among them Dr. Brandes, place it later,
      and they have some reason for their belief. The bitterness in &ldquo;Troilus and
      Cressida,&rdquo; they say rightly, is more intense; and as Shakespeare's
      disappointment with men and things appears to have increased from &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;
       to &ldquo;Timon,&rdquo; or from 1602 to 1607-8, they put the bitterer play later.
      Cogent as is this reasoning, I cannot believe that Shakespeare could have
      painted Cressida after having painted Cleopatra. The same model has
      evidently served for both women; but while Cleopatra is perhaps the most
      superb portrait of a courtesan in all literature, Cressida is a crude and
      harsh sketch such as a Dumas or a Pinero might have conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is more than probable, I think, that &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo; was planned
      and the love-story at least written about 1603, while Shakespeare's memory
      of one of his mistress's betrayals was still vivid and sharp. The play was
      taken up again four or five years later and the character of Ulysses
      deepened and strengthened. In this later revision the outlook is so
      piercing-sad, the phrases of such pregnancy, that the work must belong to
      Shakespeare's ripest maturity. Moreover, he has grown comparatively
      careless of characterization as in all his later work; he gives his wise
      sayings almost as freely to Achilles as to Ulysses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo; is interesting because it establishes the opinion
      that Chapman was indeed the rival poet whom Shakespeare referred to in the
      sonnets, and especially because it shows us the poet's mistress painted in
      a rage of erotic passion so violent that it defeats itself, and the
      portrait becomes an incredible caricature&mdash;that way madness lies.
      &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo; points to &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; and &ldquo;Timon.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. DRAMAS OF LUST: PART II. <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      We now come to the finest work of Shakespeare's maturity, to the drama in
      which his passion for Mary Fitton finds supreme expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra&rdquo; is an astonishing production not yet fairly
      appreciated even in England, and perhaps not likely to be appreciated
      anywhere at its full worth for many a year to come. But when we English
      have finally left that dark prison of Puritanism and lived for some time
      in the sun-light where the wayside crosses are hidden under climbing
      roses, we shall probably couple &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra&rdquo; with &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; in
      our love as Shakespeare's supremest works. It was fitting that the same
      man who wrote &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo; the incomparable symphony of first love,
      should also write &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo; the far more wonderful and more
      terrible tragedy of mature passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us begin with the least interesting part of the play, and we shall see
      that all the difficulties in it resolve themselves as soon as we think of
      it as Shakespeare's own confession. Wherever he leaves Plutarch, it is to
      tell his own story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some critics have reproached Shakespeare with the sensualism of &ldquo;Romeo and
      Juliet&rdquo;; no one, so far as I can remember, has blamed the Sapphic
      intensity of &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo; where the lust of the flesh and
      desire of the eye reign triumphant. Professor Dowden indeed says: &ldquo;The
      spirit of the play, though superficially it appear voluptuous, is
      essentially severe. That is to say, Shakespeare is faithful to the fact.&rdquo;
       Antony and Cleopatra kill themselves, forsooth, and thus conventional
      virtue is justified by self-murder. So superficial and false a judgement
      is a quaint example of mid-Victorian taste: it reminds me of the horsehair
      sofa and the antimacassar. Would Professor Dowden have had Shakespeare
      alter the historical facts, making Antony conquer Caesar and Cleopatra
      triumph over death? Would this have been sufficient to prove to the
      professor that Shakespeare's morals are not his, and that the play is
      certainly the most voluptuous in modern literature? Well, this is just
      what Shakespeare has done. Throughout the play Caesar is a subordinate
      figure while Antony is the protagonist and engages all our sympathies;
      whenever they meet Antony shows as the larger, richer, more generous
      nature. In every act he conquers Caesar; leaving on us the gorgeous
      ineffaceable impression of a great personality whose superb temperament
      moves everyone to admiration and love; Caesar, on the other hand, affects
      one as a calculating machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Shakespeare's fidelity to the fact is so extraordinary that he gives
      Caesar one speech which shows his moral superiority to Antony. When his
      sister weeps on hearing that Antony has gone back to Cleopatra, Caesar
      bids her dry her tears,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  ...
  But let determined things to destiny
  Hold unbewailed their way ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This line alone suffices to show why Antony was defeated; the force of
      imperial Rome is in the great phrase; but Shakespeare will not admit his
      favourite's inferiority, and in order to explain Antony's defeat
      Shakespeare represents luck as being against him, luck or fate, and this
      is not the only or even the chief proof of the poet's partiality. Pompey,
      who scarcely notices Caesar when Antony is by, says of Antony:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;his soldiership
  Is twice the other twain.&rdquo;

    <p>
      And, indeed, Antony in the play appears to be able to beat Caesar whenever
      he chooses or whenever he is not betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the personages of the play praise Antony, and when he dies the most
      magnificent eulogy of him is pronounced by Agrippa, Caesar's friend:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;A rarer spirit never
  Did steer humanity; but you, Gods, will give us
  Some faults to make us men.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Antony is even permitted at the last to console himself; he declares
      exultantly that in the other world the ghosts shall come to gaze at him
      and Cleopatra, and:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare makes conquering Caesar admit the truth of this boast:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
  A pair so famous.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      To win in life universal admiration and love, and in death imperishable
      renown, is to succeed in spite of failure and suicide, and this is the
      lesson which Shakespeare read into Plutarch's story. Even Enobarbus is
      conquered at the last by Antony's noble magnanimity. But why does
      Shakespeare show this extraordinary, this extravagant liking for him who
      was &ldquo;the bellows and the fan to cool a gipsy's lust,&rdquo; for that Marc Antony
      who might have been the master of the world, and who threw away empire,
      life, and honour to be &ldquo;a strumpet's fool?&rdquo; There is only one possible
      explanation: Shakespeare felt the most intense, the most intimate sympathy
      with Antony because he, too, was passion's slave, and had himself
      experienced with his dark mistress, Mary Fitton, the ultimate degradation
      of lust. For this reason he took Plutarch's portrait of Antony, and, by
      emphasizing the kingly traits, transformed it. In the play, as Dr. Brandes
      sees, Antony takes on something of the &ldquo;artist-nature.&rdquo; It is Antony's
      greatness and weakness; the spectacle of a high intellect struggling with
      an overpowering sensuality; of a noble nature at odds with passionate
      human frailty, that endeared him to Shakespeare. The pomp of Antony's
      position, too, and his kingly personality pleased our poet. As soon as
      Shakespeare reached maturity, he began to depict himself as a monarch;
      from &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; on he assumed royal state in his plays, and surely in
      this figure of Antony he must for the moment have satisfied his longing
      for regal magnificence and domination. From the first scene to the last
      Antony is a king of men by right divine of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, however, plain that Antony's pride, his superb mastery of life, the
      touch of imperious brutality in him, are all traits taken from Plutarch,
      and are indeed wholly inconsistent with Shakespeare's own character. Had
      Shakespeare possessed these qualities his portraits of men of action would
      have been infinitely better than they are, while his portraits of the
      gentle thinker and lover of the arts, his Hamlets and his Dukes, would
      have been to seek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The personal note of every one of his great tragedies is that Shakespeare
      feels he has failed in life, failed lamentably. His Brutus, we feel,
      failed of necessity because of his aloofness from practical life; his
      Coriolanus, too, had to fail, and almost forgoes sympathy by his faults;
      but this Antony ought not to have failed: we cannot understand why the man
      leaves the sea-battle to follow Cleopatra's flight, who but an act or two
      before, with lesser reason, realized his danger and was able to break off
      from his enchantress. Yet the passion of desire that sways Antony is so
      splendidly portrayed; is, too, so dominant in all of us, that we accept it
      at once as explaining the inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In measure as Shakespeare ennobled Antony, the historical fact of ultimate
      defeat and failure allowed him to degrade Cleopatra. And this he did
      willingly enough, for from the moment he took up the subject he identified
      the Queen of Egypt with his own faithless mistress, Mary Fitton, whom he
      had already tried to depict as &ldquo;false Cressid.&rdquo; This identification of
      himself and his own experience of passion with the persons and passions of
      the story explains some of the faults of the drama; while being the
      source, also, of its singular splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this play we have the finest possible example of the strife between
      Shakespeare's yielding poetic temperament and the severity of his
      intellect. He heaps praises on Antony, as we have seen, from all sides; he
      loved the man as a sort of superb <i>alter ego</i>, and yet his
      intellectual fairness is so extraordinary that it compelled him to create
      a character who should uphold the truth even against his heart's
      favourite. Dr. Brandes speaks of Enobarbus as a &ldquo;sort of chorus&rdquo;; he is
      far more than that; he is the intellectual conscience of the play, a
      weight, so to speak, to redress the balance which Shakespeare used this
      once and never again. What a confession this is of personal partiality! A
      single instance will suffice to prove my point: Shakespeare makes Antony
      cast the blame for the flight at Actium on Cleopatra, and manages almost
      to hide the unmanly weakness of the plaint by its infinitely pathetic
      wording:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Whither hast them led me, Egypt?
</pre>
    <p>
      A little later Cleopatra asks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Is Antony or we in fault for this?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and at once Enobarbus voices the exact truth:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Antony only, that would make his will
  Lord of his reason. What though you fled
    .       .       .       .       .       .
    .       .       . why should he follow?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again and again Antony reproaches Cleopatra, and again and again Enobarbus
      is used to keep the truth before us. Some of these reproaches, it seems to
      me, are so extravagant and so ill-founded that they discover the personal
      passion of the poet. For example, Antony insults Cleopatra:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;You have been a boggler ever.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And the proof forsooth is:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I found you as a morsel cold upon
  Dead Caesar's trencher.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But to have been Caesar's mistress was Cleopatra's chief title to fame.
      Shakespeare is here probably reviling Mary Fitton for being deserted by
      some early lover. Curiously enough, this weakness of Antony increases the
      complexity of his character, while the naturalistic passion of his words
      adds enormously to the effect of the play. Again and again in this drama
      Shakespeare's personal vindictiveness serves an artistic purpose. The
      story of &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo; is in itself low and vile, and when loaded
      with Shakespeare's bitterness outrages probability; but the love of Antony
      and Cleopatra is so overwhelming that it goes to ruin and suicide and
      beyond, and when intensified by Shakespeare's personal feeling becomes a
      world's masterpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already seen that the feminine railing Shakespeare puts in the
      mouth of Antony increases the realistic effect, and just in the same way
      the low cunning, temper, and mean greed which he attributes to Cleopatra,
      transform her from a somewhat incomprehensible historical marionette into
      the most splendid specimen of the courtesan in the world's literature.
      Heine speaks of her contemptuously as a &ldquo;kept woman,&rdquo; but the epithet only
      shows how Heine in default of knowledge fell back on his racial gift of
      feminine denigration. Even before she enters we see that Shakespeare has
      not forgiven his dark scornful mistress; Cleopatra is the finest picture
      he ever painted of Mary Fitton; but Antony's friends tell us, at the
      outset, she is a &ldquo;lustful gipsy,&rdquo; a &ldquo;strumpet,&rdquo; and at first she merely
      plays on Antony's manliness; she sends for him, and when he comes,
      departs. A little later she sends again, telling her messenger:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I did not send you: if you find him sad,
  Say, I am dancing; if in mirth, report
  That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And when Charmian, her woman, declares that the way to keep a man is to
      &ldquo;cross him in nothing,&rdquo; she replies scornfully:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thou teachest, like a fool, the way to lose him.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She uses a dozen taunts to prevent her lover from leaving her; but when
      she sees him resolved, she wishes him victory and success. And so through
      a myriad changes of mood and of cunning wiles we discover that love for
      Antony which is the anchor to her unstable nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene with the eunuch Mardian is a little gem. She asks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     &ldquo;Hast thou affections?
  <i>Mar</i>. Yes, gracious madam.
  <i>Cleo</i>.                 Indeed?
  <i>Mar</i>. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing.
  But what indeed is honest to be done;
  Yet have I fierce affections, and think
  What Venus did with Mars.
  <i>Cleo</i>.               O, Charmian!
  Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She is with her lover again, and recalls his phrase for her, &ldquo;my serpent
      of old Nile,&rdquo; and feeds herself with love's &ldquo;delicious poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner does she win our sympathy by her passion for Antony than
      Shakespeare chills our admiration by showing her as the courtesan:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Cleo</i>.            Did I, Charmian,
  Ever love Caesar so?

  <i>Char</i>.             O, that brave Caesar!

  <i>Cleo</i>. Be choked with such another emphasis!
  Say, the brave Antony.

  <i>Char</i>.                  The valiant Caesar!

  <i>Cleo</i>. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
  If thou with Caesar paragon again
  My man of men.

  <i>Char</i>.       By your most gracious pardon,
  I sing but after you.

  <i>Cleo</i>.        My salad days,
  When I was green in judgement: cold in blood,
  To say as I said then!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Already we see and know her, her wiles, her passion, her quick temper, her
      chameleon-like changes, her subtle charms of person and of word, and yet
      we have not reached the end of the first act. Next to Falstaff and to
      Hamlet, Cleopatra is the most astonishing piece of portraiture in all
      Shakespeare. Enobarbus gives the soul of her:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Ant</i>. She is cunning past man's thought.

  <i>Eno</i>. Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing
  but the finest part of pure love....

  <i>Ant</i>. Would I had never seen her!

  <i>Eno</i>. O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful
  piece of work; which not to have been blest withal would
  have discredited your travel.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here Shakespeare gives his true opinion of Mary Fitton: then comes the
      miraculous expression:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
  Her infinite variety. Other women cloy
  The appetites they feed; but she makes hungry
  Where most she satisfies.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Act by act Shakespeare makes the portrait more complex and more perfect.
      In the second act she calls for music like the dark lady of the Sonnets:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Music&mdash;moody food of us that trade in love,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and then she'll have no music, but will play billiards, and not billiards
      either, but will fish and think every fish caught an Antony. And again she
      flies to memory:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  &ldquo;That time&mdash;O times!&mdash;
  I laughed him out of patience; and that night
  I laughed him into patience; and next morn,
  Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
  Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
  I wore his sword Philippan.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The charm of it all, the deathless charm and the astounding veracity! The
      messenger enters, and she promises him for good news &ldquo;gold and her bluest
      veins to kiss.&rdquo; When she hears that Antony is well she pours more gold on
      him, but when he pauses in his recital she has a mind to strike him. When
      he tells that Caesar and Antony are friends, it is a fortune she'll give;
      but when she learns that Antony is betrothed to Octavia she turns to her
      women with &ldquo;I am pale, Charmian,&rdquo; and when she hears that Antony is
      married she flies into a fury, strikes the messenger down and hales him up
      and down the room by his hair. When he runs from her knife she sends for
      him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      &ldquo;I will not hurt him.
  These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
  A meaner than myself.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She has the fascination of great pride and the magic of manners. When the
      messenger returns she is a queen again, most courteous-wise:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Come hither, sir.
  Though it be honest, it is never good
  To bring bad news.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She wants to know the features of Octavia, her years, her inclination, the
      colour of her hair, her height&mdash;everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      A most veracious full-length portrait, with the minute finish of a
      miniature; it shows how Shakespeare had studied every fold and foible of
      Mary Fitton's soul. In the third act Cleopatra takes up again the theme of
      Octavia's appearance, only to run down her rival, and so salve her wounded
      vanity and cheat her heart to hope. The messenger, too, who lends himself
      to her humour now becomes a proper man. Shakespeare seizes every
      opportunity to add another touch to the wonderful picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cleopatra appears next in Antony's camp at Actium talking with Enobarbus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Cleo</i>. I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

  <i>Eno</i>. But why, why, why?

  <i>Cleo</i>. Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
  And say'st it is not fit.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Each phrase of the dialogue reveals her soul, dark fold on fold.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is the only person who strengthens Antony in his quixotic-foolish
      resolve to fight at sea.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Cleo</i>. I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then the shameful flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have pursued this bald analysis thus far, not for pleasure merely, but
      to show the miracle of that portraiture the traits of which can bear
      examination one by one. So far Cleopatra is, as Enobarbus calls her, &ldquo;a
      wonderful piece of work,&rdquo; a woman of women, inscrutable, cunning,
      deceitful, prodigal, with a good memory for injuries, yet as quick to
      forgiveness as to anger, a minion of the moon, fleeting as water yet
      loving-true withal, a sumptuous bubble, whose perpetual vagaries are but
      perfect obedience to every breath of passion. But now Shakespeare without
      reason makes her faithless to Antony and to love. In the second scene of
      the third act Thyreus comes to her with Caesar's message:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;<i>Thyr</i>. He knows that you embrace not Antony
  As you did love but as you feared him.

    <i>Cleo</i>.                        O!

    <i>Thyr</i>. The scars upon your honour therefore he
  Does pity as constrained blemishes,
  Not as deserved.

    <i>Cleo</i>.          He is a god, and knows
  What is most right. Mine honour was not yielded,
  But conquered merely.

    <i>Eno</i>. {<i>Aside</i>.}         To be sure of that
  I will ask Antony.&mdash;Sir, sir, thou'rt so leaky
  That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
  Thy dearest quit thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And when Thyreus asks her to leave Antony and put herself under Caesar's
      protection, who &ldquo;desires to give,&rdquo; she tells him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                            &ldquo;I am prompt
  To lay my crown at his feet, and there to kneel.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Thyreus then asks for grace to lay his duty on her hand. She gives it to
      him with the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                &ldquo;Your Caesar's father oft,
  When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
  Bestowed his lips on that unworthy place
  As it rained kisses.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is as if Antony were forgotten, clean wiped from her mind. The whole
      scene is a libel upon Cleopatra and upon womanhood. When betrayed, women
      are faithless out of anger, pique, desire of revenge; they are faithless
      out of fear, out of ambition, for fancy's sake&mdash;for fifty motives,
      but not without motive. It would have been easy to justify this scene. All
      the dramatist had to do was to show us that Cleopatra, a proud woman and
      scorned queen, could not forget Antony's faithlessness in leaving her to
      marry Octavia; but she never mentions Octavia, never seems to remember her
      after she has got Antony back. This omission, too, implies a slur upon
      her. Nor does she kiss Caesar's &ldquo;conquering hand&rdquo; out of fear. Thyreus has
      told her it would please Caesar if she would make of his fortunes a staff
      to lean upon; she has no fear, and her ambitions are wreathed round
      Antony: Caesar has nothing to offer that can tempt her, as we shall see
      later. The scene is a libel upon her. The more one studies it, the clearer
      it becomes that Shakespeare wrote it out of wounded personal feeling.
      Cleopatra's prototype, Mary Fitton, had betrayed him again and again, and
      the faithlessness rankled. Cleopatra, therefore, shall be painted as
      faithless, without cause, as Cressid was, from incurable vice of nature.
      Shakespeare tried to get rid of his bitterness in this way, and if his art
      suffered, so much the worse for his art. Curiously enough, in this
      instance, for reasons that will appear later, the artistic effect is
      deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion of this scene, where Thyreus is whipped and Cleopatra
      overwhelmed with insults by Antony, does not add much to our knowledge of
      Cleopatra's character: one may notice, however, that it is the reproach of
      cold-heartedness that she catches up to answer. The scene follows in which
      she plays squire to Antony and helps to buckle on his armour. But this
      scene (invented by Shakespeare), which might bring out the sweet
      woman-weakness in her, and so reconcile us to her again, is used against
      her remorselessly by the poet. When Antony wakes and cries for his armour
      she begs him to &ldquo;sleep a little&rdquo;; the touch is natural enough, but coming
      after her faithlessness to her lover and her acceptance of Caesar it shows
      more than human frailty. It is plain that, intent upon ennobling Antony,
      Shakespeare is willing to degrade Cleopatra beyond nature. Then comes
      Antony's victory, and his passion at length finds perfect lyrical
      expression:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;O thou day o' the world,
  Chain mine armed neck; leap thou, attire and all,
  Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
  Ride on the pants triumphing.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At once Cleopatra catches fire with that responsive flame of womanhood
      which was surely her chiefest charm:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Lord of lords!
  O infinite virtue! Com'st thou smiling from
  The world's great snare uncaught?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      What magic in the utterance, what a revelation of Cleopatra's character
      and of Shakespeare's! To Cleopatra's feminine weakness the world seems one
      huge snare which only cunning may escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day, and final irremediable defeat drives her in fear to the
      monument and to that pretended suicide which is the immediate cause of
      Antony's despair:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Unarm, Eros: the long day's task is done,
  And we must sleep.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When Antony leaves the stage, Shakespeare's idealizing vision turns to
      Cleopatra. About this point, too, the historical fact fetters Shakespeare
      and forces him to realize the other side of Cleopatra. After Antony's
      death Cleopatra did kill herself. One can only motive and explain this
      suicide by self-immolating love. It is natural that at first Shakespeare
      will have it that Cleopatra's nobility of nature is merely a reflection, a
      light borrowed from Antony. She will not open the monument to let the
      dying man enter, but her sincerity and love enable us to forgive this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  &ldquo;I dare not, dear,&mdash;
  Dear my lord, pardon,&mdash;I dare not,
  Lest I be taken....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here occurs a fault of taste which I find inexplicable. While Cleopatra
      and her women are drawing Antony up, he cries;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O quick, or I am gone.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And Cleopatra answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Here's sport, indeed!&mdash;How heavy weighs my lord!
  Our strength has all gone into heaviness,
  That makes the weight.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Here's sport, indeed&rdquo;! seems to me a terrible fault, an inexcusable
      lapse of taste. I should like to think it a misprint or misreading, but it
      is unfortunately like Shakespeare in a certain mood, possible to him, at
      least, here as elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cleopatra's lament over Antony's dead body is a piece of Shakespeare's
      self-revealing made lyrical by beauty of word and image. The allusion to
      his boy-rival, Pembroke, is unmistakable; for women are not contemptuous
      of youth:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                &ldquo;Young boys and girls
  Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
  And there is nothing left remarkable
  Beneath the visiting moon.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When Cleopatra comes to herself after swooning, her anger is
      characteristic because wholly unexpected; it is one sign more that
      Shakespeare had a living model in his mind:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                        &ldquo;It were for me
  To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
  To tell them that this world did equal theirs
  Till they had stolen our jewel. All's but naught.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Her resolve to kill herself is borrowed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;We'll bury him; and then, what's brave, what's noble,
  Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
  And make death proud to take us.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But the resolution holds:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         &ldquo;It is great
  To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
  Which shackles accidents and bolts up change.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is this greatness of soul in Cleopatra which Shakespeare has now to
      portray. Caesar's messenger, Proculeius, whom Antony has told her to
      trust, promises her everything in return for her &ldquo;sweet dependency.&rdquo; On
      being surprised she tries to kill herself, and when disarmed shows again
      that characteristic petulant anger:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
  .  .  .  .  .  This mortal house I'll ruin,
  Do Caesar what he can.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And her reasons are all of pride and hatred of disgrace. She'll not be
      &ldquo;chastised with the sober eye of dull Octavia,&rdquo; nor shown &ldquo;to the shouting
      varletry of censuring Rome.&rdquo; Her imagination is at work now, that quick
      forecast of the mind that steels her desperate resolve:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      &ldquo;Rather on Nilus' mud
  Lay me stark nak'd, and let the water-flies
  Blow me into abhorring.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The heroic mood passes. She tries to deceive Caesar as to her wealth, and
      is shamed by her treasurer Seleucus. The scene is appalling; poor human
      nature stripped to the skin&mdash;all imperfections exposed; Cleopatra
      cheating, lying, raging like a drab; her words to Seleucus are merciless
      while self-revealing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                &ldquo;O slave, of no more trust
  Than love that's hired.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This scene deepens and darkens the impression made by her unmotived
      faithlessness to Antony. It is, however, splendidly characteristic and I
      think needful; but it renders that previous avowal of faithlessness to
      Antony altogether superfluous, the sole fault in an almost perfect
      portrait. For, as I have said already, Shakespeare's mistakes in
      characterization nearly always spring from his desire to idealize; but
      here his personal vindictiveness comes to help his art. The historical
      fact compels him now to give his harlot, Cleopatra, heroic attributes; in
      spite of Caesar's threats to treat her sons severely if she dares to take
      her own life and thus deprive his triumph of its glory, she outwits him
      and dies a queen, a worthy descendant, as Charmian says, of &ldquo;many royal
      kings.&rdquo; Nothing but personal bitterness could have prevented Shakespeare
      from idealizing such a woman out of likeness to humanity. But in this
      solitary and singular case his personal suffering bound him to realism
      though the history justified idealization. The high lights were for once
      balanced by the depths of shadow, and a masterpiece was the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare leaves out Caesar's threats to put Cleopatra's sons to death;
      had he used these menaces he would have made Caesar more natural in my
      opinion, given a touch of characteristic brutality to the calculating
      intellect; but he omitted them probably because he felt that Cleopatra's
      pedestal was high enough without that addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end is very characteristic of Shakespeare's temper. Caesar becomes
      nobly generous; he approves Cleopatra's wisdom in swearing falsehoods
      about her treasure; he will not reckon with her like &ldquo;a merchant,&rdquo; and
      Cleopatra herself puts on the royal robes, and she who has played wanton
      before us so long becomes a queen of queens. And yet her character is
      wonderfully maintained; no cunning can cheat this mistress of duplicity:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;He words me, girls, he words me that I should not
  Be noble to myself.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She holds to her heroic resolve; she will never be degraded before the
      base Roman public; she will not see
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is, perhaps, worth noting here that Shakespeare lends Cleopatra, as he
      afterwards lent Coriolanus, his own delicate senses and neuropathic
      loathing for mechanic slaves with &ldquo;greasy aprons&rdquo; and &ldquo;thick breaths rank
      of gross diet&rdquo;; it is Shakespeare too and not Cleopatra who speaks of
      death as bringing &ldquo;liberty.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo; Shakespeare's mask Posthumus
      dwells on the same idea. But these lapses are momentary; the superb
      declaration that follows is worthy of the queen:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
  Of woman in me: now from head to foot
  I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
  No planet is of mine.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The scene with the clown who brings the &ldquo;pretty worm&rdquo; is the solid ground
      of reality on which Cleopatra rests for a breathing space before rising
      into the blue:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Cleo</i>. Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
  Immortal longings in me. Now no more
  The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.&mdash;
  Yare, yare, good Iras! quick.&mdash;Methinks I hear
  Antony call; I see him rouse himself
  To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
  The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
  To excuse their after-wrath. Husband, I come,
  Now to that name my courage prove my title!
  I am fire and air; my other elements
  I give to baser life.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The whole speech is miraculous in speed of mounting emotion, and when Iras
      dies first, this Cleopatra finds again the perfect word in which truth and
      beauty meet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;This proves me base:
  If she first meet the curled Antony
  He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
  Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
           {<i>To the asp, which she applies to her breast</i>.}
  With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
  Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool,
  Be angry, and despatch. O, could'st thou speak,
  That I might hear thee call great Caesar, ass
  Unpolicied!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The characteristic high temper of Mary Fitton breaking out again&mdash;&ldquo;ass
      unpolicied&rdquo;&mdash;and then the end:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                       &ldquo;Peace, peace!
  Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
  That sucks the nurse asleep?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The final touch is of soft pleasure:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;As sweet a balm, as soft as air, as gentle,&mdash;
  Antony!&mdash;Nay, I will take thee too.
               {<i>Applying another asp to her arm</i>.}
  What should I stay&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      For ever fortunate in her self-inflicted death Cleopatra thereby frees
      herself from the ignominy of certain of her actions: she is woman at once
      and queen, and if she cringes lower than other women, she rises, too, to
      higher levels than other women know. The historical fact of her
      self-inflicted death forced the poet to make false Cressid a Cleopatra&mdash;and
      his wanton gipsy-mistress was at length redeemed by a passion of heroic
      resolve. The majority of critics are still debating whether indeed
      Cleopatra is the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; of the sonnets or not. Professor Dowden puts
      forward the theory as a daring conjecture; but the identity of the two
      cannot be doubted. It is impossible not to notice that Shakespeare makes
      Cleopatra, who was a fair Greek, gipsy-dark like his sonnet-heroine. He
      says, too, of the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; of the sonnets:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
    That in the very refuse of thy deeds
  There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
    That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Enobarbus praises Cleopatra in precisely the same words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                       &ldquo;Vilest things,
  Become themselves in her.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Antony, too, uses the same expression:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     &ldquo;Fie, wrangling queen!
  Whom everything becomes&mdash;to chide, to laugh,
  To weep; whose every passion fully strives
  To make itself, in thee, fair and admired.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      These professors have no distinct mental image of the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; or of
      Cleopatra, or they would never talk of &ldquo;daring conjecture&rdquo; in regard to
      this simple identification. The points of likeness are numberless.
      Ninety-nine poets and dramatists out of a hundred would have followed
      Plutarch and made Cleopatra's love for Antony the mainspring of her being,
      the <i>causa causans</i> of her self-murder. Shakespeare does not do this;
      he allows the love of Antony to count with her, but it is imperious pride
      and hatred of degradation that compel his Cleopatra to embrace the
      Arch-fear. And just this same quality of pride is attributed to the &ldquo;dark
      lady.&rdquo; Sonnet 131 begins:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
  As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Both are women of infinite cunning and small regard for faith or truth;
      hearts steeled with an insane pride, and violent tempers suited with
      scolding slanderous tongues. Prolonged analysis is not needed. A point of
      seeming difference between them establishes their identity. Cleopatra is
      beautiful, &ldquo;a lass unparalleled,&rdquo; as Charmian calls her, and accordingly
      we can believe that all emotions became her, and that when hopping on the
      street or pretending to die she was alike be-witching; beauty has this
      magic. But how can all things become a woman who is not beautiful, whose
      face some say &ldquo;hath not the power to make love groan,&rdquo; who cannot even
      blind the senses with desire? And yet the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; of the sonnets who
      is thus described, has the &ldquo;powerful might&rdquo; of personality in as full
      measure as Egypt's queen. The point of seeming unlikeness is as convincing
      as any likeness could be; the peculiarities of both women are the same and
      spring from the same dominant quality. Cleopatra is cunning, wily,
      faithless, passionately unrestrained in speech and proud as Lucifer, and
      so is the sonnet-heroine. We may be sure that the faithlessness, scolding,
      and mad vanity of his mistress were defects in Shakespeare's eyes as in
      ours; these, indeed, were &ldquo;the things ill&rdquo; which nevertheless became her.
      What Shakespeare loved in her was what he himself lacked or possessed in
      lesser degree&mdash;that dæmonic power of personality which he makes
      Enobarbus praise in Cleopatra and which he praises directly in the
      sonnet-heroine. Enobarbus says of Cleopatra:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;I saw her once
  Hop forty paces through the public street,
  And, having lost her breath, she spoke and panted,
  That she did make defect perfection,
  And, breathless, power breathe forth.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      One would be willing to wager that Shakespeare is here recalling a
      performance of his mistress; but it is enough for my purpose now to draw
      attention to the unexpectedness of the attribute &ldquo;power.&rdquo; The sonnet
      fastens on the same word:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
  With insufficiency my heart to sway?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the same sonnet he again dwells upon her &ldquo;strength&rdquo;: she was bold, too,
      to unreason, and of unbridled tongue, for, &ldquo;twice forsworn herself,&rdquo; she
      had yet urged his &ldquo;amiss,&rdquo; though guilty of the same fault. What he
      admired most in her was force of character. Perhaps the old saying held in
      her case: <i>ex forti dulcedo</i>; perhaps her confident strength had
      abandonments more flattering and complete than those of weaker women;
      perhaps in those moments her forceful dark face took on a soulful beauty
      that entranced his exquisite susceptibility; perhaps&mdash;but the
      suppositions are infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though a lover and possessed by his mistress Shakespeare was still an
      artist. In the sonnets he brings out her overbearing will, boldness, pride&mdash;the
      elemental force of her nature; in the play, on the other hand, while just
      mentioning her &ldquo;power,&rdquo; he lays the chief stress upon the cunning wiles
      and faithlessness of her whose trade was love. But just as Cleopatra has
      power, so there can be no doubt of the wily cunning&mdash;&ldquo;the warrantise
      of skill&rdquo;&mdash;of the sonnet-heroine, and no doubt her faithlessness was
      that &ldquo;just cause of hate&rdquo; which Shakespeare bemoaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth while here to notice his perfect comprehension of the powers
      and limits of the different forms of his art. Just as he has used the
      sonnets in order to portray certain intimate weaknesses and maladies of
      his own nature that he could not present dramatically without making his
      hero ridiculously effeminate, so also he used the sonnets to convey to us
      the domineering will and strength of his mistress&mdash;qualities which if
      presented dramatically would have seemed masculine-monstrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      By taking the sonnets and the play together we get an excellent portrait
      of Shakespeare's mistress. In person she was probably tall and vain of her
      height, as Cleopatra is vain of her superiority in this respect to
      Octavia, with dark complexion, black eyebrows and hair, and pitch-black
      eyes that mirrored emotion as the lakelet mirrors the ever-changing skies;
      her cheeks are &ldquo;damask'd white&rdquo;; her breath fragrant with health, her
      voice melodious, her movements full of dignity&mdash;a superb gipsy to
      whom beauty may be denied but not distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we have a very good idea of her person we have a still better idea of
      her mind and soul. I must begin by stating that I do not accept implicitly
      Shakespeare's angry declarations that his mistress was a mere strumpet. A
      nature of great strength and pride is seldom merely wanton; but the fact
      stands that Shakespeare makes a definite charge of faithlessness against
      his mistress; she is, he tells us, &ldquo;the bay where all men ride&rdquo;; no
      &ldquo;several plot,&rdquo; but &ldquo;the wide world's common place.&rdquo; The accusation is
      most explicit. But if it were well founded why should he devote two
      sonnets (135 and 136) to imploring her to be as liberal as the sea and to
      receive his love-offering as well as the tributes of others?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Among a number one is reckon'd none
  Then in the number let me pass untold.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is plain that Mistress Fitton drew away from Shakespeare after she had
      given herself to his friend, and this fact throws some doubt upon his
      accusations of utter wantonness. A true &ldquo;daughter of the game,&rdquo; as he says
      in &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida,&rdquo; is nothing but &ldquo;a sluttish spoil of
      opportunity&rdquo; who falls to Troilus or to Diomedes in turn, knowing no
      reserve. It must be reckoned to the credit of Mary Fitton, or to her
      pride, that she appears to have been faithful to her lover for the time
      being, and able to resist even the solicitings of Shakespeare. But her
      desires seem to have been her sole restraint, and therefore we must add an
      extraordinary lewdness to that strength, pride, and passionate temper
      which Shakespeare again and again attributes to her. Her boldness is so
      reckless that she shows her love for his friend even before Shakespeare's
      face; she knows no pity in her passion, and always defends herself by
      attacking her accuser. But she is cunning in love's ways and dulls
      Shakespeare's resentment with &ldquo;I don't hate you.&rdquo; Unwilling perhaps to
      lose her empire over him and to forego the sweetness of his honeyed
      flatteries, she blinded him to her faults by occasional caresses. Yet this
      creature, with the soul of a strumpet, the tongue of a fishwife and the
      &ldquo;proud heart&rdquo; of a queen, was the crown and flower of womanhood to
      Shakespeare, his counterpart and ideal. Hamlet in love with Cleopatra, the
      poet lost in desire of the wanton&mdash;that is the tragedy of
      Shakespeare's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this wonderful world of ours great dramatic writers are sure to have
      dramatic lives. Again and again in his disgrace Antony cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Whither hast thou led me, Egypt?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's passion for Mary Fitton led him to shame and madness and
      despair; his strength broke down under the strain and he never won back
      again to health. He paid the price of passion with his very blood. It is
      Shakespeare and not Antony who groans:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,&mdash;
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
  Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's love for Mary Fitton is to me one of the typical tragedies
      of life&mdash;a symbol for ever. In its progress through the world genius
      is inevitably scourged and crowned with thorns and done to death;
      inevitably, I say, for the vast majority of men hate and despise what is
      superior to them: Don Quixote, too, was trodden into the mire by the
      swine. But the worst of it is that genius suffers also through its own
      excess; is bound, so to speak, to the stake of its own passionate
      sensibilities, and consumed, as with fire.

      CHAPTER XI. THE DRAMA OF MADNESS: &ldquo;LEAR&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Ever since Lessing and Goethe it has been the fashion to praise
      Shakespeare as a demi-god; whatever he wrote is taken to be the rose of
      perfection. This senseless hero-worship, which reached idolatry in the
      superlatives of the &ldquo;Encyclopaedia Britannica&rdquo; and elsewhere in England,
      was certain to provoke reaction, and the reaction has come to vigorous
      expression in Tolstoi, who finds nothing to praise in any of Shakespeare's
      works, and everything to blame in most of them, especially in &ldquo;Lear.&rdquo; Lamb
      and Coleridge, on the other hand, have praised &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; as a world's
      masterpiece. Lamb says of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While we read it, we see not Lear; but we are Lear,&mdash;we are in his
      mind, we are sustained by a grandeur which baffles the malice of daughters
      and storms; in the aberrations of his reason we discover a mighty
      irregular power of reasoning, immethodised from the ordinary purposes of
      life, but exerting its powers, as the wind bloweth where it listeth, at
      will upon the corruptions and abuses of mankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coleridge calls &ldquo;Lear,&rdquo; &ldquo;the open and ample playground of Nature's
      passions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These dithyrambs show rather the lyrical power of the writers than the
      thing described.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tolstoi, on the other hand, keeps his eyes on the object, and sets himself
      to describe the story of &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; &ldquo;as impartially as possible.&rdquo; He says of
      the first scene:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Not to mention the pompous, characterless language
  of King Lear, the same in which all Shakespeare's kings
  speak, the reader or spectator cannot conceive that a
  king, however old and stupid he may be, could believe
  the words of the vicious daughters with whom he had
  passed his whole life, and not believe his favourite
  daughter, but curse and banish her; and therefore, the
  spectator or reader cannot share the feelings of the
  persons participating in this unnatural scene.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He goes on to condemn the scene between Gloucester and his sons in the
      same way. The second act he describes as &ldquo;absurdly foolish.&rdquo; The third act
      is &ldquo;spoiled, by the characteristic Shakespearean language.&rdquo; The fourth act
      is &ldquo;marred in the making,&rdquo; and of the fifth act, he says: &ldquo;Again begin
      Lear's awful ravings, at which one feels ashamed, as at unsuccessful
      jokes.&rdquo; He sums up in these words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Such is this celebrated drama. However absurd it
  may appear in my rendering (which I have endeavoured
  to make as impartial as possible), I may confidently say
  that in the original it is yet more absurd. For any man
  of our time&mdash;if he were not under the hypnotic suggestion
  that this drama is the height of perfection&mdash;it would
  be enough to read it to its end (were he to have sufficient
  patience for this) in order to be convinced that, far from
  being the height of perfection, it is a very bad, carelessly-composed
  production, which, if it could have been of
  interest to a certain public at a certain time, cannot evoke
  amongst us anything but aversion and weariness. Every
  reader of our time who is free from the influence of suggestion
  will also receive exactly the same impression from
  all the other extolled dramas of Shakespeare, not to mention
  the senseless dramatized tales, 'Pericles,' 'Twelfth
  Night,' 'The Tempest,' 'Cymbeline,' and 'Troilus and
  Cressida.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Every one must admit, I think, that what Tolstoi has said of the
      hypothesis of the play is justified. Shakespeare, as I have shown, was
      nearly always an indifferent playwright, careless of the architectural
      construction of his pieces, contemptuous of stage-craft. So much had
      already been said in England, if not with the authority of Tolstoi.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be conceded, too, that the language which Shakespeare puts into
      Lear's mouth in the first act is &ldquo;characterless and pompous,&rdquo; even silly;
      but Tolstoi should have noticed that as soon as Lear realizes the
      ingratitude of his daughters, his language becomes more and more simple
      and pathetic. Shakespeare's kings are apt to rant and mouth when first
      introduced; he seems to have thought pomp of speech went with royal robes;
      but when the action is engaged even his monarchs speak naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, that just as the iambics of Greek drama were lifted above
      ordinary conversation, so Shakespeare's language, being the language
      mainly of poetic and romantic drama, is a little more measured and, if you
      will, more pompous than the small talk of everyday life, which seems to
      us, accustomed as we are to prose plays, more natural. Shakespeare,
      however, in his blank verse, reaches heights which are not often reached
      by prose, and when he pleases, his verse becomes as natural-easy as any
      prose, even that of Tolstoi himself. Tolstoi finds everything Lear says
      &ldquo;pompous,&rdquo; &ldquo;artificial,&rdquo; &ldquo;unnatural,&rdquo; but Lear's words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Pray do not mock me,
  I am a very foolish-fond old man
  Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less,
  And, to deal plainly
  I fear I am not in my perfect mind.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      touch us poignantly, just because of their childish simplicity; we feel as
      if Lear, in them, had reached the heart of pathos. Tolstoi, I am afraid,
      has missed all the poetry of Lear, all the deathless phrases. Lear says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;I am a man,
  More sinn'd against than sinning,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and the new-coined phrase passed at once into the general currency. Who,
      too, can ever forget his description of the poor?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
  That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
  How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
  Your looped and windowed raggedness, defend you
  From seasons such as these?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The like of that &ldquo;looped and windowed raggedness&rdquo; is hardly to be found in
      any other literature. In the fourth and fifth acts Lear's language is
      simplicity itself, and even in that third act which Tolstoi condemns as
      &ldquo;incredibly pompous and artificial,&rdquo; we find him talking naturally:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ha! here 's three on's are sophisticated: thou art
  the thing itself, unaccommodated man is no more but
  such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There is still another reason why some of us cannot read &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; with the
      cold eyes of reason, contemptuously critical. &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; marks a stage in
      Shakespeare's agony. We who know the happy ingenuousness of his youth
      undimmed by doubts of man or suspicions of woman, cannot help sympathizing
      with him when we see him cheated and betrayed, drinking the bitter cup of
      disillusion to the dregs. In &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; the angry brooding leads to madness;
      and it is only fitting that the keynote of the tragedy, struck again and
      again, should be the cry.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet Heaven!
  Keep me in temper: I would not be mad.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; is the first attempt in all literature to paint madness, and not
      the worst attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;Lear,&rdquo; Shakespeare was intent on expressing his own disillusion and
      naked misery. How blind Lear must have been, says Tolstoi; how incredibly
      foolish not to know his daughters better after living with them for twenty
      years; but this is just what Shakespeare wishes to express: How blind I
      was, he cries to us, how inconceivably trusting and foolish! How could I
      have imagined that a young noble would be grateful, or a wanton true?
      &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; is a page of Shakespeare's autobiography, and the faults of it are
      the stains of his blistering tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; is badly constructed, but worse was to come. The next tragedy,
      &ldquo;Timon,&rdquo; is merely a scream of pain, and yet it, too, has a deeper than
      artistic interest for us as marking the utmost limit of Shakespeare's
      suffering. The mortal malady of perhaps the finest spirit that has ever
      appeared among men has an interest for us profounder than any tragedy. And
      to find that in Shakespeare's agony and bloody sweat he ignores the rules
      of artistry is simply what might have been expected, and, to some of us,
      deepens the personal interest in the drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; Edgar is peculiarly Shakespeare's mouthpiece, and to Edgar
      Shakespeare gives some of the finest words he ever coined:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
  Make instruments to plague us.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Here, too, in what Edgar says of himself, is the moral of all passion: it
      is manifestly Shakespeare's view of himself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A most poor man, made tame to Fortune's blows,
  Who by the art of knowing and feeling sorrows
  Am pregnant to good pity.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then we find the supreme phrase&mdash;perhaps the finest ever written:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              &ldquo;Men must endure
  Their going hence even as their coming hither.
  Ripeness is all.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare speaks through Lear in the last acts as plainly as through
      Edgar. In the third scene of the fifth act Lear talks to Cordelia in the
      very words Shakespeare gave to the saint Henry VI. at the beginning of his
      career. Compare the extracts on pages 118-9 with the following passage,
      and you will see the similarity and the astounding growth in his art.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              &ldquo;... Come, let's away to prison:
  We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
  When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down
  And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
  And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
  At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
  Talk of court news; ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      More characteristic still of Shakespeare is the fact that when Lear is at
      his bitterest in the fourth act, he shows the erotic mania which is the
      source of all Shakespeare's bitterness and misery; but which is utterly
      out of place in Lear. The reader will mark how &ldquo;adultery&rdquo; is dragged in:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;... Ay, every inch a king:
  When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
  I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
  Adultery?
  Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
  The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
  Does lecher in my sight.
  Let copulation thrive; ...
  ...
  Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
  Though women all above;
  But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
  Beneath is all the fiends'; ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Thus Lear raves for a whole page: Shakespeare on his hobby: in the same
      erotic spirit he makes both Goneril and Regan lust after Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note of this tragedy is Shakespeare's understanding of his insane
      blind trust in men; but the passion of it springs from erotic mania and
      from the consciousness that he is too old for love's lists. Perhaps his
      imagination never carried him higher than when Lear appeals to the heavens
      because they too are old:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;... O heavens,
  If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
  Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
  Make it your cause.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE DRAMA OF DESPAIR: &ldquo;TIMON OF ATHENS&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Timon&rdquo; marks the extremity of Shakespeare's suffering. It is not to be
      called a work of art, it is hardly even a tragedy; it is the causeless
      ruin of a soul, a ruin insufficiently motived by complete trust in men and
      spendthrift generosity. If there was ever a man who gave so lavishly as
      Timon, if there was ever one so senseless blind in trusting, then he
      deserved his fate. There is no gradation in his giving, and none in his
      fall; no artistic crescendo. The whole drama is, as I have said, a scream
      of suffering, or rather, a long curse upon all the ordinary conditions of
      life. The highest qualities of Shakespeare are not to be found in the
      play. There are none of the magnificent phrases which bejewel &ldquo;Lear&rdquo;;
      little of high wisdom, even in the pages which are indubitably
      Shakespeare's, and no characterization worth mentioning. The honest
      steward, Flavius, is the honest Kent again of &ldquo;Lear,&rdquo; honest and loyal
      beyond nature; Apemantus is another Thersites. Words which throw a high
      light on Shakespeare's character are given to this or that personage of
      the play without discrimination. One phrase of Apemantus is as true of
      Shakespeare as of Timon and is worth noting:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the
  extremity of both ends.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
The tragic sonnet-note is given to Flavius:
  &ldquo;What viler thing upon the earth than friends
  Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In so far as Timon is a character at all he is manifestly Shakespeare,
      Shakespeare who raves against the world, because he finds no honesty in
      men, no virtue in women, evil everywhere&mdash;&ldquo;boundless thefts in
      limited professions.&rdquo; This Shakespeare-Timon swings round
      characteristically as soon as he finds that Flavius is honest:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Had I a steward
  So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
  It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
  Let me behold thy face. Surely this man
  Was born of woman.
  <i>Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
  You perpetual-sober gods</i>! I do proclaim
  One honest man&mdash;mistake me not&mdash;but one ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I cannot help putting the great and self-revealing line {Footnote: This
      passage is among those rejected by the commentators as un-Shakespearean:
      &ldquo;it does not stand the test,&rdquo; says the egregious Gollancz.} in italics; a
      line Tolstoi would, no doubt, think stupid-pompous. Timon ought to have
      known his steward, one might say in Tolstoi's spirit, as Lear should have
      known his daughters; but this is still the tragedy, which Shakespeare
      wishes to emphasize that his hero was blind in trusting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end Shakespeare speaks through Timon quite unfeignedly:
      Richard II. said characteristically:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Nor I nor any man that but man is
  With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
  With being nothing:&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And Timon says to Flavius:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                          &ldquo;My long sickness
  Of health and living now begins to mend
  And nothing brings me all things.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then the end:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
  Upon the beachèd verge of the salt flood....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      We must not leave this play before noticing the overpowering erotic strain
      in Shakespeare which suits Timon as little as it suited Lear. The long
      discussion with Phrynia and Timandra is simply dragged in: neither woman
      is characterized: Shakespeare-Timon eases himself in pages of erotic
      raving:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;... Strike me the counterfeit matron;
  It is her habit only that is honest,
  Herself's a bawd:...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Consumptions sow
  In hollow bones of man...........
  ...............Down with the nose,
  Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;damned earth&rdquo; even is &ldquo;the common whore of mankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Timon&rdquo; is the true sequel to &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice.&rdquo; Antonio gives
      lavishly, but is saved at the crisis by his friends. Timon gives with both
      hands, but when he appeals to his friends, is treated as a bore.
      Shakespeare had travelled far in the dozen years which separate the two
      plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Shakespeare's tragedies are phases of his own various weaknesses, and
      each one brings the hero to defeat and ruin. Hamlet cannot carry revenge
      to murder and fails through his own irresolution. Othello comes to grief
      through mad jealousy. Antony fails and falls through excess of lust; Lear
      through trust in men, and Timon through heedless generosity. All these are
      separate studies of Shakespeare's own weaknesses; but the ruin is
      irretrievable, and reaches its ultimate in Timon. Trust and generosity,
      Shakespeare would like to tell us, were his supremest faults. In this he
      deceived himself. Neither &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; nor &ldquo;Timon&rdquo; is his greatest tragedy; but
      &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo; for lust was his chief weakness, and the tragedy
      of lust his greatest play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of &ldquo;Timon&rdquo; is not Shakespeare's, the critics tell us, and some of it
      is manifestly not his, though many of the passages rejected with the best
      reason have, I think, been touched up by him. The second scene of the
      first act is as bad as bad can be; but I hear his voice in the line:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
  And ne'er be weary.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At any rate, this is the keynote of the tragedy, which is struck again and
      again. Shakespeare probably exaggerated his generosity out of aristocratic
      pose; but that he was careless of money and freehanded to a fault, is, I
      think, certain from his writings, and can be proved from the facts known
      to us of his life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. SHAKESPEARE'S LAST ROMANCES: ALL COPIES.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <i>&ldquo;Winters Tale&rdquo;: &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo;: &ldquo;The Tempest.&rdquo;</i>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The wheel has swung full circle: Timon is almost as weak as &ldquo;Titus
      Andronicus&rdquo;; the pen falls from the nerveless hand. Shakespeare wrote
      nothing for some time. Even the critics make a break after &ldquo;Timon,&rdquo; which
      closes what they are pleased to call his third period; but they do not
      seem to see that the break was really a breakdown in health. In &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; he
      had brooded and raged to madness; in &ldquo;Timon&rdquo; he had spent himself in
      futile, feeble cursings. His nerves had gone to pieces. He was now
      forty-five years of age, the forces of youth and growth had left him. He
      was prematurely old and feeble.
    </p>
    <p>
      His recovery, it seems certain, was very slow, and he never again, if I am
      right, regained vigorous health, I am almost certain he went down to
      Stratford at this crisis and spent some time there, probably a couple of
      years, trying, no doubt, to staunch the wound in his heart, and win back
      again to life. The fear of madness had frightened him from brooding: he
      made up his mind to let the dead past bury its dead; he would try to
      forget and live sanely. After all, life is better than death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably his daughter who led him back from the brink of the grave.
      Almost all his latest works show the same figure of a young girl. He seems
      now, for the first time, to have learned that a maiden can be pure, and in
      his old idealizing way which went with him to the end, he deified her.
      Judith became a symbol to him, and he lent her the ethereal grace of
      abstract beauty. In &ldquo;Pericles&rdquo; she is Marina; in &ldquo;The Winter's Tale&rdquo;
       Perdita; in &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo; Miranda. It is probable when one comes to think
      of it, that Ward was right when he says that Shakespeare spent his &ldquo;elder
      years&rdquo; in Stratford; he was too broken to have taken up his life in London
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assertion that Shakespeare broke down in health, and never won back to
      vigorous life, will be scorned as my imagining. The critics who have
      agreed to regard &ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Winter's Tale,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo; as
      his finest works are all against me on this point, and they will call for
      &ldquo;Proofs, proofs. Give us proofs,&rdquo; they will cry, &ldquo;that the man who went
      mad and raved with Lear, and screamed and cursed in &ldquo;Timon&rdquo; did really
      break down, and was not imagining madness and despair.&rdquo; The proofs are to
      be found in these works themselves, plain for all men to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three chief works of his last period are romances and are all copies;
      he was too tired to invent or even to annex; his own story is the only one
      that interests him. The plot of &ldquo;The Winter's Tale&rdquo; is the plot of &ldquo;Much
      Ado about Nothing.&rdquo; Hero is Hermione. Another phase of &ldquo;Much Ado About
      Nothing&rdquo; is written out at length in &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo;; Imogen suffers like Hero
      and Hermione, under unfounded accusation. It is Shakespeare's own history
      turned from this world to fairyland: what would have happened, he asks, if
      the woman whom I believed false, had been true? This, the theme of &ldquo;Much
      Ado,&rdquo; is the theme also of &ldquo;The Winter's Tale&rdquo; and of &ldquo;Cymbeline.&rdquo; The
      idealism of the man is inveterate: he will not see that it was his own
      sensuality which gave him up to suffering, and not Mary Fitton's
      faithlessness. &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo; is the story of &ldquo;As you Like it.&rdquo; We have
      again the two dukes, the exiled good Duke, who is Shakespeare, and the bad
      usurping Duke, Shakespeare's rival, Chapman, who has conquered for a time.
      Shakespeare is no longer able or willing to discover a new play: he can
      only copy himself, and in one of the scenes which he wrote into &ldquo;Henry
      VIII.&rdquo; the copy is slavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I allude to the third scene in the second act; the dialogue between Anne
      Bullen and the Old Lady is extraordinarily reminiscent. When Anne Bullen
      says&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;'Tis better to be lowly born,
  And range with humble livers in content,
  Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief
  And wear a golden sorrow&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I am reminded of Henry VI. And the contention between Anne Bullen and the
      Old Lady, in which Anne Bullen declares that she would not be a queen, and
      the Old Lady scorns her:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Beshrew me, I would,
  And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,
  For all this spice of your hypocrisy.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      is much the same contention, and is handled in the same way as the
      contention between Desdemona and Emilia in &ldquo;Othello.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are many other proofs of Shakespeare's weakness of hand throughout
      this last period, if further proofs were needed. The chief characteristics
      of Shakespeare's health are his humour, his gaiety, and wit&mdash;his love
      of life. A correlative characteristic is that all his women are sensuous
      and indulge in coarse expressions in and out of season. This is said to be
      a fault of his time; but only professors could use an argument which shows
      such ignorance of life. Homer was clean enough, and Sophocles, Spenser,
      too; sensuality is a quality of the individual man. Still another
      characteristic of Shakespeare's maturity is that his characters, in spite
      of being idealized, live for us a vigorous, pulsing life.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these characteristics are lacking in the works after &ldquo;Timon.&rdquo; There is
      practically no humour, no wit, the clowns even are merely boorish-stupid
      with the solitary exception of Autolycus, who is a pale reflex of one or
      two characteristics of Falstaff. Shakespeare's humour has disappeared, or
      is so faint as scarcely to be called humour; all the heroines, too, are
      now vowed away from sensuality: Marina passes through the brothel
      unsoiled; Perdita might have milk in her veins, and not blood, and Miranda
      is but another name for Perdita. Imogen, too, has no trace of natural
      passion in her: she is a mere washing-list, so to speak, of sexless
      perfections. In this last period Shakespeare will have nothing to do with
      sensuality, and his characters, and not the female characters alone, are
      hardly more than abstractions; they lack the blood of emotion; there is
      not one of them could cast a shadow. How is it that the critics have
      mistaken these pale, bloodless silhouettes for Shakespeare's masterpieces?
    </p>
    <p>
      In his earliest works he was compelled, as we have seen, to use his own
      experiences perpetually, not having had any experience of life, and in
      these, his latest plays, he also uses when he can his own experiences to
      give his pictures of the world from which he had withdrawn, some sense of
      vivid life. For example, in &ldquo;Winter's Tale&rdquo; his account of the death of
      the boy Mamillius is evidently a reflex of his own emotion when he lost
      his son, Hamnet, an emotion which at the time he pictured deathlessly in
      Arthur and the grief of the Queen-mother Constance. Similarly, in
      &ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo; the joy of the brothers in finding the sister is an echo of
      his own pleasure in getting to know his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have an idea about the genesis of these last three plays as regards
      their order which may be wholly false, though true, I am sure, to
      Shakespeare's character. I imagine he was asked by the author to touch up
      &ldquo;Pericles.&rdquo; On reading the play, he saw the opportunity of giving
      expression to the new emotion which had been awakened in him by the
      serious sweet charm of his young daughter, and accordingly he wrote the
      scenes in which Marina figures. Judith's modesty was a perpetual wonder to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His success induced him to sketch out &ldquo;The Winter's Tale,&rdquo; in which tale
      he played sadly with what might have been if his accused love, Mary
      Fitton, had been guiltless instead of guilty. I imagine he saw that the
      play was not a success, or supreme critic as he was, that his hand had
      grown weak, and seeking for the cause he probably came to the conclusion
      that the comparative failure was due to the fact that he did not put
      himself into &ldquo;The Winter's Tale,&rdquo; and so he determined in the next play to
      draw a full-length portrait of himself again, as he had done in &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo;
       and accordingly he sketched Posthumus, a staider, older, idealized Hamlet,
      with lymph in his veins, instead of blood. In the same idealizing spirit,
      he pictured his rose of womanhood for us in Imogen, who is, however, not a
      living woman at all, any more than his earliest ideal, Juliet, was a
      woman. The contrast between these two sketches is the contrast between
      Shakespeare's strength and his weakness. Here is how the fourteen-year-old
      Juliet talks of love:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
  That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo
  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
  Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
  By their own beauties.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And here what Posthumus says of Imogen:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd,
  And pray'd me oft forbearance: did it with
  A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
  Might well have warmed old Saturn.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Neither of these statements is very generally true: but the second is out
      of character. When Shakespeare praises restraint in love he must have been
      very weak; in full manhood he prayed for excess of it, and regarded a
      surfeit as the only rational cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think Shakespeare liked Posthumus and Imogen; but he could not have
      thought &ldquo;Cymbeline&rdquo; a great work, and so he pulled himself together for a
      masterpiece. He seems to have said to himself, &ldquo;All that fighting of
      Posthumus is wrong; men do not fight at forty-eight; I will paint myself
      simply in the qualities I possess now; I will tell the truth about myself
      so far as I can.&rdquo; The result is the portrait of Prospero in &ldquo;The Tempest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let me just say before I begin to study Prospero that I find the
      introduction of the Masque in the fourth act extraordinarily interesting.
      Ben Jonson had written classic masques for this and that occasion; masques
      which were very successful, we are told; they had &ldquo;caught on,&rdquo; in fact, to
      use our modern slang. Shakespeare will now show us that he, too, can write
      a masque with classic deities in it, and better Jonson's example. It is
      pitiful, and goes to prove, I think, that Shakespeare was but little
      esteemed by his generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonson answered him conceitedly, as Jonson would, in the Introduction to
      his &ldquo;Bartholomew Fair&rdquo; (1612-14), &ldquo;If there be never a <i>Servant monster</i>
      i' the Fayre, who can help it, he sayes; nor a nest of <i>Antiques</i>. He
      is loth to make nature afraid in his <i>Playes</i>, like those that beget
      <i>Tales</i>, <i>Tempests</i>, and such like <i>Drolleries</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the very end, the creator of Hamlet, the finest mind in the world, was
      eager to show that he could write as well in any style as the author of
      &ldquo;Every Man in his Humour.&rdquo; To me the bare fact is full of interest, and
      most pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now turn to &ldquo;The Tempest,&rdquo; and see how our poet figures in it. It
      is Shakespeare's last work, and one of his very greatest; his testament to
      the English people; in wisdom and high poetry a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait of Shakespeare we get in Prospero is astonishingly faithful
      and ingenuous, in spite of its idealization. His life's day is waning to
      the end; shadows of the night are drawing in upon him, yet he is the same
      bookish, melancholy student, the lover of all courtesies and generosities,
      whom we met first as Biron in &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost.&rdquo; The gaiety is gone
      and the sensuality; the spiritual outlook is infinitely sadder&mdash;that
      is what the years have done with our gentle Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prospero's first appearance in the second scene of the first act is as a
      loving father and magician; he says to Miranda:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I have done nothing but in care of thee,
  Of thee, my dear one! thee, my daughter.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He asks Miranda what she can remember of her early life, and reaches
      magical words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;What seest thou else
  In the dark backward and abysm of time?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Miranda is only fifteen years of age. Shakespeare turned Juliet, it will
      be remembered, from a girl of sixteen into one of fourteen; now, though
      the sensuality has left him, he makes Miranda only fifteen; clearly he is
      the same admirer of girlish youth at forty-eight as he was twenty years
      before. Then Prospero tells Miranda of himself and his brother, the
      &ldquo;perfidious&rdquo; Duke:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And Prospero, the prime Duke, being so reputed
  In dignity, and for the liberal arts
  Without a parallel; those being all my study.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He will not only be a Prince now, but a master &ldquo;without a parallel&rdquo; in the
      liberal arts. He must explain, too, at undue length, how he allowed
      himself to be supplanted by his false brother, and speaks about himself in
      Shakespeare's very words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicate
  To closeness, and the bettering of my mind
  With that, which, but by being so retired,
  O'erprized all popular rate, in my false brother
  Awaked an evil nature: and my trust,
  Like a good parent, did beget of him,
  A falsehood, in its contrary as great
  As my trust was; which had, indeed, no limit,
  A confidence sans bound.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare, too, &ldquo;neglecting worldly ends,&rdquo; had dedicated himself to
      &ldquo;bettering of his mind,&rdquo; we may be sure. Prospero goes on to tell us
      explicitly how Shakespeare loved books, which we were only able to infer
      from his earlier plays:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Me, poor man, my library
  Was dukedom large enough.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And again, Gonzalo (another name for Kent and Flavius) having given him
      some books, he says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Of his gentleness,
  Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me
  From my own library, with volumes that
  I prize above my dukedom.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      His daughter grieves lest she had been a trouble to him: forthwith
      Shakespeare-Prospero answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;O, a cherubim
  Thou wast, that did preserve me. Thou didst smile
  Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
  When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt
  Under my burden groan'd; which raised in me
  An undergoing stomach, to bear up
  Against what should ensue.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But why should the magician weep or groan under a burden? had he no
      confidence in his miraculous powers? All this is Shakespeare's confession.
      Every word is true; his daughter did indeed &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; Shakespeare, and
      enable him to bear up under the burden of life's betrayals.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder Prospero begins to apologize for this long-winded confession,
      which indeed is &ldquo;most impertinent&rdquo; to the play, as he admits, though most
      interesting to him and to us, for he is simply Shakespeare telling us his
      own feelings at the time. The gentle magician then hears from Ariel how
      the shipwreck has been conducted without harming a hair of anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole scene is an extraordinarily faithful and detailed picture of
      Shakespeare's soul. I find significance even in the fact that Ariel wants
      his freedom &ldquo;a full year&rdquo; before the term Prospero had originally
      proposed. Shakespeare finished &ldquo;The Tempest,&rdquo; I believe, and therewith set
      the seal on his life's work a full year earlier than he had intended; he
      feared lest death might surprise him before he had put the pinnacle on his
      work. Ariel's torment, too, is full of meaning for me; for Ariel is
      Shakespeare's &ldquo;shaping spirit of imagination,&rdquo; who was once the slave of
      &ldquo;a foul witch,&rdquo; and by her &ldquo;imprisoned painfully&rdquo; for &ldquo;a dozen years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;dozen years&rdquo; is to me astonishingly true and interesting: it shows
      that my reading of the duration of his passion-torture was absolutely
      correct&mdash;Shakespeare's &ldquo;delicate spirit&rdquo; and best powers bound to
      Mary Fitton's &ldquo;earthy&rdquo; service from 1597 to 1608.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can perhaps fix this latter date with some assurance. Mistress Fitton
      married for the second time a Captain or Mr. Polwhele late in 1607, or
      some short time before March, 1608, when the fact of her recent marriage
      was recorded in the will of her great uncle. It seems to me probable, or
      at least possible, that this event marks her complete separation from
      Shakespeare; she may very likely have left the Court and London on ceasing
      to be a Maid of Honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare is so filled with himself in this last play, so certain that
      he is the most important person in the world, that this scene is more
      charged with intimate self-revealing than any other in all his works. And
      when Ferdinand comes upon the stage Shakespeare lends him, too, his own
      peculiar qualities. His puppets no longer interest him; he is careless of
      characterization. Ferdinand says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;This music crept by me upon the waters
  Allaying both their fury and my passion
  With its sweet air.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Music, it will be remembered, had precisely the same peculiar effect upon
      Duke Orsino in &ldquo;Twelfth Night.&rdquo; Ferdinand, too, is extraordinarily
      conceited:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am the best of them that speak this speech.
  .... Myself am Naples.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's natural aristocratic pride as a Prince reinforced by his
      understanding of his own real importance. Ferdinand then declares he will
      be content with a prison if he can see Miranda in it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Space enough
  Have I in such a prison.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Which is Hamlet's:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself
  a king of infinite space.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The second act, with its foiled conspiracy, is wretchedly bad, and the
      meeting of Caliban and Trinculo with Stephanie does not improve it much,
      Shakespeare has little interest now in anything outside himself: age and
      greatness are as self-centred as youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third act the courtship of Ferdinand and Miranda is pretty, but
      hardly more. Ferdinand is bloodless, thin, and Miranda swears &ldquo;by her
      modesty,&rdquo; as the jewel in her dower, which takes away a little from the
      charming confession of girl-love:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;I would not wish
  Any companion in the world but you.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The comic relief which follows is unspeakably dull; but the words of
      Ariel, warning the King of Naples and the usurping Duke that the wrong
      they have done Prospero is certain to be avenged unless blotted out by
      &ldquo;heart-sorrow and a clear life ensuing,&rdquo; are most characteristic and
      memorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fourth act Prospero preaches, as we have seen, self-restraint to
      Ferdinand in words which, in their very extravagance, show how deeply he
      regretted his own fault with his wife before marriage. I shall consider
      the whole passage when treating of Shakespeare's marriage as an incident
      in his life. Afterwards comes the masque, and the marvellous speech of
      Prospero, which touches the highest height of poetry:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;These our actors,
  As I foretold you, were all spirits, and
  Are melted into air, into thin air:
  And, like the baseless fabric of this vision
  The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,
  The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
  Yea, all which it inhabit, shall dissolve
  And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
  Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
  As dreams are made of; and our little life
  Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
  Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:
  Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
  If you be pleased, retire into my cell,
  And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
  To still my beating mind.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I have given the verses to the very end, for I find the insistence on his
      age and weakness (which are not in keeping with the character of a
      magician), a confession of Shakespeare himself: the words &ldquo;beating mind&rdquo;
       are extraordinarily characteristic, proving as they do that his thoughts
      and emotions were too strong for his frail body.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fifth act Shakespeare-Prospero shows himself to us at his noblest:
      he will forgive his enemies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
  Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury
  Do I take part: the rarer action is
  In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
  The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
  Not a frown further.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&rdquo; we saw how Shakespeare-Valentine forgave
      his faithless friend as soon as he repented: here is the same creed
      touched to nobler expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, with all his wishes satisfied, his heart's desire accomplished,
      Prospero is ready to set out for Milan again and home. We all expect some
      expression of joy from him, but this is what we get:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And thence retire me to my Milan, where
  Every third thought shall be my grave.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The despair is wholly unexpected and out of place, as was the story of his
      weakness and infirmity, his &ldquo;beating mind.&rdquo; It is evidently Shakespeare's
      own confession. After writing &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo; he intends to retire to
      Stratford, where &ldquo;every third thought shall be my grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have purposely drawn special attention to Shakespeare's weakness and
      despair at this time, because the sad, rhymed Epilogue which has to be
      spoken by Prospero has been attributed to another hand by a good many
      scholars. It is manifestly Shakespeare's, out of Shakespeare's very heart
      indeed; though Mr. Israel Gollancz follows his leaders in saying that the
      &ldquo;Epilogue to the play is evidently by some other hand than Shakespeare's&rdquo;:
      &ldquo;evidently&rdquo; is good. Here it is:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
  And what strength I have's mine own,
  Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
  I must be here confined by you,
  Or sent to Naples. Let me not
  Since I have my dukedom got,
  And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
  In this bare island by your spell;
  But release me from my bands
  With the help of your good hands:
  Gentle breath of yours my sails
  Must fill, or else my project fails,
  Which was to please. Now I want,
  Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;
  And my ending is despair,
  Unless I be relieved by prayer,
  Which pierces so that it assaults
  Mercy itself, and frees all faults
  As you from crimes would pardon'd be
  Let your indulgence set me free.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      From youth to age Shakespeare occupied himself with the deepest problems
      of human existence; again and again we find him trying to pierce the
      darkness that enshrouds life. Is there indeed nothing beyond the grave&mdash;nothing?
      Is the noble fabric of human thought, achievement and endeavour to fade
      into nothingness and pass away like the pageant of a dream? He will not
      cheat himself with unfounded hopes, nor delude himself into belief; he
      resigns himself with a sigh&mdash;it is the undiscovered country, from
      whose bourn no traveller returns. But Shakespeare always believed in
      repentance and forgiveness, and now, world-weary, old and weak, he turns
      to prayer, {Footnote: Hamlet, too, after speaking with his father's ghost,
      cries: &ldquo;I'll go pray."} prayer that&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;assaults
  Mercy itself and frees all faults.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Poor, broken Shakespeare! &ldquo;My ending is despair&rdquo;: the sadness of it, and
      the pity, lie deeper than tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a man! to produce a masterpiece in spite of such weakness. What a
      play is this &ldquo;Tempest&rdquo;! At length Shakespeare sees himself as he is, a
      monarch without a country; but master of a very &ldquo;potent art,&rdquo; a great
      magician, with imagination as an attendant spirit, that can conjure up
      shipwrecks, or enslave enemies, or create lovers at will; and all his
      powers are used in gentle kindness. Ariel is a higher creation, more
      spiritual and charming than any other poet has ever attempted; and
      Caliban, the earth-born, half-beast, half-man&mdash;these are the poles of
      Shakespeare's genius.

      CHAPTER XIV. SHAKESPEARE'S LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our long travail is almost at an end. We have watched Shakespeare painting
      himself at various periods of his life, and at full length in twenty
      dramas, as the gentle, sensuous poet-thinker. We have studied him when
      given over to wild passion in the sonnets and elsewhere, and to insane
      jealousy in &ldquo;Othello&rdquo;; we have seen him as Hamlet brooding on revenge and
      self-murder, and in &ldquo;Lear,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Timon&rdquo; raging on the verge of madness,
      and in these ecstasies, when the soul is incapable of feigning, we have
      discovered his true nature as it differed from the ideal presentments
      which his vanity shaped and coloured. We have corrected his personal
      estimate by that &ldquo;story of faults conceal'd&rdquo; which Shakespeare himself
      referred to in sonnet 88. It only remains for me now to give a brief
      account of his life and the incidents of it to show that my reading of his
      character is borne out by the known facts, and thus put the man in his
      proper setting, so to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, our knowledge of Shakespeare's character will help us
      to reconstruct his life-story. What is known positively of his life could
      be given in a couple of pages; but there are traditions of him, tales
      about him, innumerable scraps of fact and fiction concerning him which are
      more or less interesting and authentic; and now that we know the man, we
      shall be able to accept or reject these reports with some degree of
      confidence, and so arrive at a credible picture of his life's journey, and
      the changes which Time wrought in him. In all I may say about him I shall
      keep close to the facts as given in his works. When tradition seems
      consonant with what Shakespeare has told us about himself, or with what
      Ben Jonson said of him, I shall use it with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was a common name in Warwickshire; other Shakespeares besides
      the poet's family were known there in the sixteenth century, and at least
      one other William Shakespeare in the neighbourhood of Stratford. The
      poet's father, John Shakespeare, was of farmer stock, and seems to have
      had an adventurous spirit: he left Snitterfield, his birthplace, as a
      young man, for the neighbouring town of Stratford, where he set up in
      business for himself. Aubrey says he was a butcher; he certainly dealt in
      meat, skins, and leather, as well as in corn, wool, and malt&mdash;an
      adaptable, quick man, who turned his hand to anything&mdash;a
      Jack-of-all-trades. He appears to have been successful at first, for in
      1556, five years after coming to Stratford, he purchased two freehold
      tenements, one with a garden in Henley Street, and the other in Greenhill
      Street, with an orchard. In 1557 he was elected burgess, or town
      councillor, and shortly afterwards did the best stroke of business in his
      life by marrying Mary Arden, whose father had been a substantial farmer.
      Mary inherited the fee simple of Asbies, a house with some fifty acres of
      land at Wilmcote, and an interest in property at Snitterfield; the whole
      perhaps worth some £80 or £90, or, say, £600 of our money. His marriage
      turned John Shakespeare into a well-to-do citizen; he filled various
      offices in the borough, and in 1568 became a bailiff, the highest position
      in the corporation. During his year of office, we are told, he entertained
      two companies of actors at Stratford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Arden seems to have been her father's favourite child, and though she
      could not sign her own name, must have possessed rare qualities; for the
      poet, as we learn from &ldquo;Coriolanus,&rdquo; held her in extraordinary esteem and
      affection, and mourned her after her death as &ldquo;the noblest mother in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Shakespeare, the first son and third child of this couple, was
      born on the 22nd or 23rd April, 1564, no one knows which day; the
      Stratford parish registers prove that he was baptized on 26th April. And
      if the date of his birth is not known, neither is the place of it; his
      father owned two houses in Henley Street, and it is uncertain which he was
      born in.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Shakespeare had, fortunately, nothing to pay for the education of his
      sons. They had free tuition at the Grammar School at Stratford. The poet
      went to school when he was seven or eight years of age, and received an
      ordinary education together with some grounding in Latin. He probably
      spent most of his time at first making stories out of the frescoes on the
      walls. There can be no doubt that he learned easily all he was taught, and
      still less doubt that he was not taught much. He mastered Lyly's &ldquo;Latin
      Grammar,&rdquo; and was taken through some conversation books like the
      &ldquo;Sententiae Pueriles,&rdquo; and not much further, for he puts Latin phrases in
      the mouth of the schoolmasters, Holofernes in &ldquo;Love's Labour's Lost,&rdquo; and
      Hugh Evans in &ldquo;The Merry Wives of Windsor,&rdquo; and all these phrases are
      taken word for word either from Lyly's Grammar or from the &ldquo;Sententiae
      Pueriles.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Titus Andronicus,&rdquo; too, one of Tamora's sons, on reading a
      Latin couplet, says it is a verse of Horace, but he &ldquo;read it in the
      grammar,&rdquo; which was probably the author's case. Ben Jonson's sneer was
      well-founded, Shakespeare had &ldquo;little Latine and lesse Greeke.&rdquo; His
      French, as shown in his &ldquo;Henry V.,&rdquo; was anything but good, and his Italian
      was probably still slighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was lucky for Shakespeare that his father's increasing poverty withdrew
      him from school early, and forced him into contact with life. Aubrey says
      that &ldquo;when he was a boy he exercised his father's trade {of butcher}; but
      when he kill'd a calfe he would doe it in high style and make a speech.&rdquo; I
      daresay young Will flourished about with a knife and made romantic
      speeches; but I am pretty sure he never killed a calf. Killing a calf is
      not the easiest part of a butcher's business; nor a task which Shakespeare
      at any time would have selected. The tradition is simply sufficient to
      prove that the town folk had already noticed the eager, quick, spouting
      lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Shakespeare's life after he left school, say from thirteen to eighteen,
      we know almost nothing. He probably did odd jobs for his father from time
      to time; but his father's business seems to have run rapidly from bad to
      worse; for in 1586 a creditor informed the local Court that John
      Shakespeare had no goods on which distraint could be levied, and on 6th
      September of the same year he was deprived of his alderman's gown. During
      this period of steadily increasing poverty in the house it was only to be
      expected that young Will Shakespeare would run wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tradition as given by Rowe says that he fell &ldquo;into low company, and
      amongst them some that made a frequent practice of deer-stealing engaged
      him with them more than once in robbing the park of Sir Thomas Lucy of
      Charlecot, near Stratford. For this he was prosecuted by that gentleman,
      as he then thought somewhat too severely, and in order to revenge that
      ill-usage he made a ballad upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another story has it that Sir Thomas Lucy got a lawyer from Warwick to
      prosecute the boys, and that Shakespeare stuck his satirical ballad to the
      park gates at Charlecot. The ballad is said to have been lost, but certain
      verses were preserved which fit the circumstances and suit Shakespeare's
      character so perfectly that I for one am content to accept them. I give
      the first and the last verses as most characteristic:
    </p>
    <h3>
      SONG
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;A parliament member, a Justice of peace,
  At home a poor scarecrow, in London an asse,
  If Lowsie is lucy, as some volke miscalle it
  Then Lucy is lowsie, whatever befalle it.
      He thinks himself greate
      Yet an asse in his state,
  We allowe by his ears but with asses to mate.
  If Lucy is lowsie, as some volke miscalle it
  Sing lowsie Lucy whatever befalle it.
         - -       - -       - -       - -
  &ldquo;If a juvenile frolick he cannot forgive,
  We'll sing lowsie Lucy as long as we live,
  And Lucy, the lowsie, a libel may calle it
  Sing lowsie Lucy whatever befalle it.
    He thinks himself greate
    Yet an asse in his state,
  We allowe by his ears but with asses to mate.
  If Lucy is lowsie, as some volke miscalle it
  Sing lowsie Lucy, Whatever befalle it.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The last verse, so out of keeping in its curious impartiality with the
      scurrilous refrain, appears to me to carry its own signature. There can be
      no doubt that the verses give us young Shakespeare's feelings in the
      matter. It was probably reading ballads and tales of &ldquo;Merrie Sherwood&rdquo;
       that first inclined him to deer-stealing; and we have already seen from
      his &ldquo;Richard II.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Henry IV.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Henry V.&rdquo; that he had been led
      astray by low companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his idle, high-spirited youth, Shakespeare did worse than break bounds
      and kill deer; he was at a loose end and up to all sorts of mischief. At
      eighteen he had already courted and won Anne Hathaway, a farmer's daughter
      of the neighbouring village of Shottery. Anne was nearly eight years older
      than he was. Her father had died a short time before and left Anne, his
      eldest daughter, £6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., or, say, £50 of our money. The
      house at Shottery, now shown as Anne Hathaway's cottage, once formed part
      of Richard Hathaway's farmhouse, and there, and in the neighbouring lanes,
      the lovers did their courting. The wooing on Shakespeare's side was
      nothing but pastime, though it led to marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      His marriage is perhaps the first serious mistake that Shakespeare made,
      and it certainly influenced his whole life. It is needful, therefore, to
      understand it as accurately as may be, however we may judge it. A man's
      life, like a great river, may be limpid-pure in the beginning, and when
      near its source; as it grows and gains strength it is inevitably sullied
      and stained with earth's soilure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ordinary apologists would have us believe that the marriage was happy;
      they know that Shakespeare was not married in Stratford, and, though a
      minor, his parents' consent to the marriage was not obtained; but they
      persist in talking about his love for his wife, and his wife's devoted
      affection for him. Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps, the bell-wether of the flock,
      has gone so far as to tell us how on the morning of the day he died &ldquo;his
      wife, who had smoothed the pillow beneath his head for the last time, felt
      that her right hand was taken from her.&rdquo; Let us see if there is any
      foundation for this sentimental balderdash. Here are some of the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Bishop of Worcester's register a licence was issued on 27th
      November, 1582, authorizing the marriage of William Shakespeare with Anne
      Whately, of Temple Grafton. On the very next day in the register of the
      same Bishop there is a deed, wherein Fulk Sandells and John Richardson,
      farmers of Shottery, bound themselves in the Bishop's court under a surety
      of £40 to free the Bishop of all liability should a lawful impediment&mdash;&ldquo;by
      reason of any pre-contract or consanguinity&rdquo;&mdash;be subsequently
      disclosed to imperil the validity of the marriage, then in contemplation,
      of William Shakespeare with Anne Hathaway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dryasdust, of course, argues that there is no connection whatever between
      these two events. He is able to persuade himself easily that the William
      Shakespeare who got a licence to marry Anne Whately, of Temple Grafton, on
      27th November, 1582, is not the same William Shakespeare who is being
      forced to marry Anne Hathaway on the next day by two friends of Anne
      Hathaway's father. Yet such a coincidence as two William Shakespeares
      seeking to be married by special licence in the same court at the same
      moment of time is too extraordinary to be admitted. Besides, why should
      Sandells and Richardson bind themselves as sureties in £40 to free the
      Bishop of liability by reason of any pre-contract if there were no
      pre-contract? The two William Shakespeares are clearly one and the same
      person. Sandells was a supervisor of the will of Richard Hathaway, and was
      described in the will as &ldquo;my trustie friende and neighbour.&rdquo; He showed
      himself a trusty friend of the usual sort to his friend's daughter, and
      when he heard that loose Will Shakespeare was attempting to marry Anne
      Whately, he forthwith went to the same Bishop's court which had granted
      the licence, pledged himself and his neighbour, Richardson, as sureties
      that there was no pre-contract, and so induced the Bishop, who no doubt
      then learned the unholy circumstances for the first time, to grant a
      licence in order that the marriage with Anne Hathaway could be celebrated,
      &ldquo;with once asking of the bannes&rdquo; and without the consent of the father of
      the bridegroom, which was usually required when the bridegroom was a
      minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly Fulk Sandells was a masterful man; young Will Shakespeare was
      forced to give up Anne Whately, poor lass, and marry Anne Hathaway, much
      against his will. Like many another man, Shakespeare married at leisure,
      and repented in hot haste. Six months later a daughter was born to him,
      and was baptized in the name of Susanna at Stratford Parish Church on the
      26th of May, 1583. There was, therefore, an importunate reason for the
      wedding, as Sandells, no doubt, made the Bishop understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole story, it seems to me, is in perfect consonance with
      Shakespeare's impulsive, sensual nature; is, indeed, an excellent
      illustration of it. Hot, impatient, idle Will got Anne Hathaway into
      trouble, was forced to marry her, and at once came to regret. Let us see
      how far these inferences from plain facts are borne out from his works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important passages seem to have escaped critical scholarship. I
      have already said that the earliest works of Shakespeare, and the latest,
      are the most fruitful in details about his private life. In the earliest
      works he was compelled to use his own experience, having no observation of
      life to help him, and at the end of his life, having said almost
      everything he had to say, he again went back to his early experience for
      little vital facts to lend a colour to the fainter pictures of age. In
      &ldquo;The Winter's Tale,&rdquo; a shepherd finds the child Perdita, who has been
      exposed; one would expect him to stumble on the child by chance and
      express surprise; but this shepherd of Shakespeare begins to talk in this
      way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty, or that youth
      would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but getting
      wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting. Hark you
      now! Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty hunt
      this weather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now this passage has nothing to do with the play, nor with the shepherd's
      occupation; nor is it at all characteristic of a shepherd boy. Between ten
      and three-and-twenty a poor shepherd boy is likely to be kept hard at
      work; he is not idle and at a loose end like young Shakespeare, free to
      rob the ancientry, steal, fight, and get wenches with child. That, in my
      opinion, is Shakespeare's own confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, every one has noticed how Shakespeare again and again in his
      plays declares that a woman should take in marriage an &ldquo;elder than
      herself,&rdquo; and that intimacy before marriage is productive of nothing but
      &ldquo;barren hate and discord.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; he says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Let still the woman take
  An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
  So sways she level in her husband's heart.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo; he writes again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;If thou dost break her virgin knot before
  All sanctimonious ceremonies may
  With full and holy rite be minister'd,
  No sweet aspersions shall the heavens let fall
  To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
  Sour-ey'd disdain, and discord, shall bestrew
  The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
  That you shall hate it both.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      These admonitions are so far-fetched and so emphatic that they plainly
      discover personal feeling. We have, besides, those quaint, angry passages
      in the &ldquo;Comedy of Errors,&rdquo; to which we have already drawn attention, which
      show that the poet detested his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The known facts, too, all corroborate this inference: let us consider them
      a little. The first child was born within six months of the marriage;
      twins followed in 1585; a little later Shakespeare left Stratford not to
      return to it for eight or nine years, and when he did return there was
      probably no further intimacy with his wife; at any rate, there were no
      more children. Yet Shakespeare, one fancies, was fond of children. When
      his son Hamnet died his grief showed itself in his work&mdash;in &ldquo;King
      John&rdquo; and in &ldquo;The Winter's Tale.&rdquo; He was full of loving kindness to his
      daughters, too, in later life; it was his wife alone for whom he had no
      affection, no forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other facts which establish this conclusion. While Shakespeare
      was in London he allowed his wife to suffer the extremes of poverty.
      Sometime between 1585 and 1595 she appears to have borrowed forty
      shillings from Thomas Whittington, who had formerly been her father's
      shepherd. The money was still unpaid when Whittington died, in 1601, and
      he directed his executor to recover the sum from the poet, and distribute
      it among the poor of Stratford. Now Shakespeare was rich when he returned
      to Stratford in 1595, and always generous. He paid off his father's heavy
      debts; how came it that he did not pay this trifling debt of his wife? The
      mere fact proves beyond doubt that Shakespeare disliked her and would have
      nothing to do with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even towards the end of his life, when he was suffering from increasing
      weakness, which would have made most men sympathetic, even if it did not
      induce them completely to relent, Shakespeare shows the same aversion to
      his poor wife. In 1613, when on a short visit to London, he bought a house
      in Blackfriars for £140; in the purchase he barred his wife's dower, which
      proceeding seems even to Dryasdust &ldquo;pretty conclusive proof that he had
      the intention of excluding her from the enjoyment of his possessions after
      his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the first draft of his will Shakespeare did not mention his wife. The
      apologists explain this by saying that, of course, he had already given
      her all that she ought to have. But if he loved her he would have
      mentioned her with affection, if only to console her in her widowhood.
      Before the will was signed he inserted a bequest to her of his
      &ldquo;second-best bed,&rdquo; and the apologists have been at pains to explain that
      the best bed was kept for guests, and that Shakespeare willed to his wife
      the bed they both occupied. How inarticulate poor William Shakespeare must
      have become! Could the master of language find no better word than the
      contemptuous one? Had he said &ldquo;our bed&rdquo; it would have been enough; &ldquo;the
      second-best bed&rdquo; admits of but one interpretation. His daughters, who had
      lived with their mother, and who had not been afflicted by her jealousy
      and scolding tongue, begged the dying man to put in some mention of her,
      and he wrote in that &ldquo;second-best bed&rdquo;&mdash;bitter to the last. If his
      own plain words and these inferences, drawn from indisputable facts, are
      not sufficient, then let us take one fact more, and consider its
      significance; one fact, so to speak, from the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Shakespeare died he left some lines to be placed over his tomb. Here
      they are:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare
  To Digg the dust enclosed heare.
  Blessed be ye man yt spares thes stones
  And Curst be ye yt moves my bones.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Now, why did Shakespeare make this peculiar request? No one seems to have
      seen any meaning in it. It looks to me as if Shakespeare wrote the verses
      in order to prevent his wife being buried with him. He wanted to be free
      of her in death as in life. At any rate, the fact is that she was not
      buried with him, but apart from him; he had seen to that. His grave was
      never opened, though his wife expressed a desire to be buried with him.
      The man who needs further proofs would not be persuaded though one came
      from the dead to convince him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage was an unfortunate one for many reasons, as an enforced
      marriage is apt to be, even when it is not the marriage of a boy in his
      teens to a woman some eight years his senior. Shakespeare takes trouble to
      tell us in &ldquo;The Comedy of Errors&rdquo; that his wife was spitefully jealous,
      and a bitter scold. She must have injured him, poisoned his life with her
      jealous nagging, or Shakespeare would have forgiven her. There is some
      excuse for him, if excuse be needed. At the time the marriage must have
      seemed the wildest folly to him, seething as he was with inordinate
      conceit. He was wise beyond his years, and yet he had been forced to give
      hostages to fortune before he had any means of livelihood, before he had
      even found a place in life. What a position for a poet&mdash;penniless,
      saddled with a jealous wife and three children before he was twenty-one.
      And this poet was proud, and vain, and in love with all distinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why did Shakespeare nurse such persistent enmity all through his life
      to jealous, scolding Anne Hathaway? Shakespeare had wronged her; the
      keener his moral sense, the more certain he was to blame his partner in
      the fault, for in no other way could he excuse himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was overpowering sensuality and rashness which had led Shakespeare into
      the noose, and now there was nothing for it but to cut the rope. He had
      either to be true to his higher nature or to the conventional view of his
      duty; he was true to himself and fled to London, and the world is the
      richer for his decision. The only excuse he ever made is to be found in
      the sonnet-line:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Love is too young to know what conscience is.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      For my part I do not see that any excuse is needed: if Shakespeare had
      married Anne Whately he might never have gone to London or written a play.
      Shakespeare's hatred of his wife and his regret for having married her
      were alike foolish. Our brains are seldom the wisest part of us. It was
      well that he made love to Anne Hathaway; well, too, that he was forced to
      marry her; well, finally, that he should desert her. I am sorry he treated
      her badly and left her unsupplied with money; that was needlessly cruel;
      but it is just the kindliest men who have these extraordinary lapses;
      Shakespeare's loathing for his wife was measureless, was a part of his own
      self-esteem, and his self-esteem was founded on snobbish non-essentials
      for many years, if not, indeed, throughout his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a tradition preserved by Rowe that before going to London young
      Shakespeare taught school in the country; it may be; but he did not teach
      for long, we can be sure, and what he had to teach there were few scholars
      in the English country then or now capable of learning. Another tradition
      asserts that he obtained employment as a lawyer's clerk, probably because
      of the frequent use of legal phrases in his plays. But these apologists
      all forget that they are speaking of men like themselves, and of times
      like ours. Politics is the main theme of talk in our day; but in the time
      of Elizabeth it was rather dangerous to show one's wisdom by criticizing
      the government: law was then the chief staple of conversation: every
      educated man was therefore familiar with law and its phraseology, as men
      are familiar in our day with the jargon of politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      When did Shakespeare fly to London? Some say when he was twenty-one, as
      soon as his wife presented him with twins, in 1585. Others say as soon as
      Sir Thomas Lucy's persecution became intolerable. Both causes no doubt
      worked together, and yet another cause, given in &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of
      Verona,&rdquo; was the real <i>causa causans</i>. Shakespeare was naturally
      ambitious; eager to measure himself with the best and try his powers.
      London was the arena where all great prizes were to be won: Shakespeare
      strained towards the Court like a greyhound in leash. But when did he go?
      Again in doubt I take the shepherd's words in &ldquo;The Winter's Tale&rdquo; as a
      guide. Most men would have said from fourteen to twenty was the dangerous
      age for a youth; but Shakespeare had perhaps a personal reason for the
      peculiar &ldquo;ten to twenty-three.&rdquo; He was, no doubt, astoundingly precocious,
      and probably even at ten he had learned everything of value that the
      grammar school had to teach, and his thoughts had begun to play truant.
      Twenty-three, too, is a significant date in his life; in 1587, when he was
      twenty-three, two companies of actors, under the nominal patronage of the
      Queen and Lord Leicester, returned to London from a provincial tour,
      during which they visited Stratford. In Lord Leicester's company were
      Burbage and Heminge, with whom we know that Shakespeare was closely
      connected in later life. It seems to me probable that he returned with
      this company to London, and arrived in London, as he tells us in &ldquo;The
      Comedy of Errors,&rdquo; &ldquo;stiff and weary with long travel,&rdquo; and at once went
      out to view the town and &ldquo;peruse the traders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a tradition that when he came to London in 1587 he held horses
      outside the doors of the theatre. This story was first put about by the
      compiler of &ldquo;The Lives of the Poets,&rdquo; in 1753. According to the author the
      story was related by D'Avenant to Betterton; but Rowe, to whom Betterton
      must have told it, does not transmit it. Rowe was perhaps right to forget
      it or leave it out; though the story is not in itself incredible. Such
      work must have been infinitely distasteful to Shakespeare, but necessity
      is a hard master, and Greene, who talks of him later as &ldquo;Shake-scene,&rdquo;
       also speaks in the same connection of these &ldquo;grooms.&rdquo; The curious
      amplified version of the story that Shakespeare organized a service of
      boys to hold the horses is hardly to be believed. The great Doctor was
      anything but a poet, or a good judge of the poetic temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shakespeares of this world are not apt to take up menial employs, and
      this one had already shown that he preferred idle musings and parasitic
      dependence to uncongenial labour. Whoever reads the second scene of the
      second act of &ldquo;The Comedy of Errors,&rdquo; will see that Shakespeare, even at
      the beginning, had an uncommonly good opinion of himself. He plays
      gentleman from the first, and despises trade; he snubs his servant and
      will not brook familiarity from him. In &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona,&rdquo; he
      tells us that he left the country and came to London seeking &ldquo;honour,&rdquo;
       intending, no doubt, to make a name for himself by his writings. He had
      probably &ldquo;Venus and Adonis&rdquo; in his pocket when he first reached London.
      This would inspire a poet with the self-confidence which a well-filled
      purse lends to an ordinary man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am inclined to accept Rowe's statement that Shakespeare was received
      into an actor-company at first in a very mean rank. The parish clerk of
      Stratford at the end of the seventeenth century used to tell the visitors
      that Shakespeare entered the playhouse as a servitor; but, however he
      entered it, it is pretty certain he was not long in a subordinate
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      What manner of man was William Shakespeare when he first fronted life in
      London somewhere about 1587? Aubrey tells us that he was &ldquo;a handsome,
      well-shap't man, very good company, and of a very readie and pleasant
      smooth witt.&rdquo; The bust of him in Stratford Church was coloured; it gave
      him light hazel eyes, and auburn hair and beard. Rowe says of him that
      &ldquo;besides the advantages of his witt, he was in himself a good-natured man,
      of too great sweetness in his manners, and a most agreeable companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I picture him to myself very like Swinburne&mdash;of middle height or
      below it, inclined to be stout; the face well-featured, with forehead
      domed to reverence and quick, pointed chin; a face lighted with
      hazel-clear vivid eyes and charming with sensuous-full mobile lips that
      curve easily to kisses or gay ironic laughter; an exceedingly sensitive,
      eager speaking face that mirrors every fleeting change of emotion....
    </p>
    <p>
      I can see him talking, talking with extreme fluency in a high tenor voice,
      the reddish hair flung back from the high forehead, the eyes now dancing,
      now aflame, every feature quick with the &ldquo;beating mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And such talk&mdash;the groundwork of it, so to speak, very
      intimate-careless; but gemmed with thoughts, diamonded with wit, rhythmic
      with feeling: don't we know how it ran&mdash;&ldquo;A hundred and fifty tattered
      prodigals.... No eye hath seen such scarecrows, ... discarded, unjust
      serving-men, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and
      ostlers trade-fallen: the cankers of a calm world and a long peace.&rdquo; And
      after the thought the humour again&mdash;&ldquo;food for powder, food for
      powder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now let us consider some of his other qualities. In 1592 he published his
      &ldquo;Venus and Adonis,&rdquo; which he had no doubt written in 1587 or even earlier,
      for he called it &ldquo;the first heir of my invention&rdquo; when he dedicated it to
      Lord Southampton. This work is to me extremely significant. It is all
      concerned with the wooing of young Adonis by Venus, an older woman. Now,
      goddesses have no age, nor do women, as a rule, woo in this sensual
      fashion. The peculiarities point to personal experience. &ldquo;I, too,&rdquo;
       Shakespeare tells us practically, &ldquo;was wooed by an older woman against my
      will.&rdquo; He seems to have wished the world to accept this version of his
      untimely marriage. Young Shakespeare in London was probably a little
      ashamed of being married to some one whom he could hardly introduce or
      avow. The apologists who declare that he made money very early in his
      career give us no explanation of the fact that he never brought his wife
      or children to London. Wherever we touch Shakespeare's intimate life, we
      find proof upon proof that he detested his wife and was glad to live
      without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looked at in this light &ldquo;Venus and Adonis&rdquo; is not a very noble thing to
      have written; but I am dealing with a young poet's nature, and the
      majority of young poets would like to forget their Anne Hathaway if they
      could; or, to excuse themselves, would put the blame of an ill-sorted
      union upon the partner to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a certain weakness, however, shown in the whole story of his
      marriage; a weakness of character, as well as a weakness of <i>morale</i>,
      which it is impossible to ignore; and there were other weaknesses in
      Shakespeare, especially a weakness of body which must necessarily have had
      its correlative delicacies of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have pointed out in the first part of this book that sleeplessness was a
      characteristic of Shakespeare, even in youth; he attributes it to Henry
      IV. in old age, and to Henry V., a youth at the time, who probably never
      knew what a sleepless night meant. Shakespeare's <i>alter ego</i>,
      Valentine, in &ldquo;The Two Gentlemen of Verona,&rdquo; suffers from it, and so do
      Macbeth and Hamlet, and a dozen others of his chief characters, in
      particular his impersonations&mdash;all of which shows, I think, that from
      the beginning the mind of Shakespeare was too strong for his body. As we
      should say to-day, he was too emotional, and lived on his nerves. I always
      think of him as a ship over-engined; when the driving-power is working at
      full speed it shakes the ship to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other weakness is marked in him, and that is that he could not drink,
      could not carry his liquor like a man&mdash;to use our accepted phrase.
      Hamlet thought drinking a custom more honoured in the breach than in the
      observance; Cassius, Shakespeare's incarnation in &ldquo;Othello,&rdquo; confessed
      that he had &ldquo;poor unhappy brains for drinking&rdquo;: tradition informs us that
      Shakespeare himself died of a &ldquo;feavour&rdquo; from drinking&mdash;all of which
      confirms my opinion that Shakespeare was delicate rather than robust. He
      was, also, extraordinarily fastidious: in drama after drama he rails
      against the &ldquo;greasy&rdquo; caps and &ldquo;stinking&rdquo; breath of the common people. This
      overstrained disgust suggests to me a certain delicacy of constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is still another indication of bodily weakness which in itself
      would be convincing to those accustomed to read closely; but which would
      carry little or no weight to the careless. In sonnet 129 Shakespeare tells
      us of lust and its effects, and the confession seems to me purely
      personal. Here are four lines of it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
  Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
  Past reason hated, as a swallowed bait,
  On purpose laid to make the taker mad.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Now, this is not the ordinary man's experience of passion and its effects.
      &ldquo;Past reason hunted,&rdquo; such an one might say, but he would certainly not go
      on &ldquo;No sooner had, Past reason hated.&rdquo; He is not moved to hate by
      enjoyment, but to tenderness; it is your weakling who is physically
      exhausted by enjoyment who is moved to hatred. This sonnet was written by
      Shakespeare in the prime of manhood at thirty-four or thirty-five at
      latest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was probably healthy as a young man, but intensely sensitive
      and highly strung; too finely constituted ever to have been strong. One
      notices that he takes no pleasure in fighting; his heroes are, of course,
      all &ldquo;valiant,&rdquo; but he shows no loving interest in the game of fighting as
      a game. In fact, we have already seen that he found no wonderful phrase
      for any of the manly virtues; he was a neuropath and a lover, and not a
      fighter, even in youth, or Fulk Sandells might have rued his interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dominating facts to be kept ever in mind about Shakespeare are that he
      was delicate in body, and over-excitable; yielding and irresolute in
      character; with too great sweetness of manners and inordinately given to
      the pleasures of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      How would such a man fare in the world of London in 1587? It was a wild
      and wilful age; eager English spirits were beginning to take a part in the
      opening up of the new world; the old, limiting horizons were gone; men
      dared to think for themselves and act boldly; ten years before Drake had
      sailed round the world&mdash;the adventurer was the characteristic product
      of the time. In ordinary company a word led to a blow, and the fight was
      often brought to a fatal conclusion with dagger or sword or both. In those
      rough days actors were almost outlaws; Ben Jonson is known to have killed
      two or three men; Marlowe died in a tavern brawl. Courage has always been
      highly esteemed in England, like gentility and a university training.
      Shakespeare possessed none of these passports to public favour. He could
      not shoulder his way through the throng. The wild adventurous life of the
      time was not to his liking, even in early manhood; from the beginning he
      preferred &ldquo;the life removed&rdquo; and his books; all given over to the
      &ldquo;bettering of his mind&rdquo; he could only have been appreciated at any time by
      the finer spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the theatre as a servitor he no doubt made such acquaintances as
      offered themselves, and spent a good deal of his leisure perforce with
      second-rate actors and writers in common taverns and studied his Bardolph
      and Pistol, and especially his Falstaff at first hand. Perhaps Marlowe was
      one of his <i>ciceroni</i> in rough company. Shakespeare had almost
      certainly met Marlowe very early in his career, for he worked with him in
      the &ldquo;Third Part of Henry VI.,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Richard III.&rdquo; is a conscious
      imitation of Marlowe, and Marlowe was dissipated enough and wild enough to
      have shown him the wildest side of life in London in the '80's. It was the
      very best thing that could have happened to delicate Shakespeare, to come
      poor and unknown to London, and be soused in common rowdy life like this
      against his will by sheer necessity; for if left to his own devices he
      would probably have grown up a bookish poet&mdash;a second Coleridge. Fate
      takes care of her favourites.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all in his favour that he should have been forced at first to win
      his spurs as an actor. He must have been too intelligent, one would think,
      ever to have brought it far as a mummer; he looked upon the half-art of
      acting with disdain and disgust, as he tells us in the sonnets, and if in
      Hamlet he condescends to give advice to actors, it is to admonish them not
      to outrage the decencies of nature by tearing a passion to tatters. He had
      at hand a surer ladder to fame than the mummer's art. As soon as he felt
      his feet in London he set to work adapting plays, and writing plays, while
      reading his own poetry to all and sundry who would listen, and I have no
      doubt that patrons of the stage, who were also men of rank, were willing
      to listen to Shakespeare from the beginning. He was of those who require
      no introductions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1592, four or five years after his arrival in London, he had already
      come to the front as a dramatist, or at least as an adapter of plays, for
      Robert Greene, a scholar and playwright, attacked him in his &ldquo;Groatsworth
      of Wit&rdquo; in this fashion:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;There is an upstart Crow, beautified in our feathers
  that, with his tiger's heart wrapt in a player's hide, supposes
  he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as
  the best of you, and, being an absolute Johannes fac
  totum, is, in his own conceit, the only Shakescene in a
  country. Oh, that I might intreat your rare wits to be
  employed in more profitable courses, and let these apes
  imitate your past excellence, and never more acquaint
  them with your admired inventions.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is plain from this weird appeal that Shakespeare had already made his
      mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are further proofs of his rapid success. One of Chettle's references
      to Shakespeare (I take Chettle to be the original of Falstaff) throws
      light upon the poet's position in London in these early days. Shortly
      after Greene had insulted Shakespeare as &ldquo;Shake-scene&rdquo; Chettle apologized
      for the insult in these terms:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am as sorry,&rdquo; Chettle wrote, &ldquo;as if the original
  fault had beene my fault, because myselfe have seen his
  (<i>i.e.</i>, Shakespeare's) demeanour no less civill than he (is)
  exelent in the qualitie he professes. Besides, divers of
  worship have reported his uprightnes of dealing, which
  argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing that
  aprooves his art.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In 1592, then, Shakespeare was most &ldquo;civill in demeanour,&rdquo; and had won
      golden opinions from people of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actors and poets of that time could not help knowing a good many of the
      young nobles who came to the theatre and sat round the stage listening to
      the performances. And Shakespeare, with his aristocratic sympathies and
      charming sweetness of nature, must have made friends with the greatest
      ease. Chettle's apology proves that early in his career he had the art or
      luck to win distinguished patrons who spoke well of him. While still new
      to town he came to know Lord Southampton, to whom he dedicated &ldquo;Venus and
      Adonis&rdquo;; the fulsome dedication of &ldquo;Lucrece&rdquo; to the same nobleman two
      years later shows that deference had rapidly ripened into affectionate
      devotion; no wonder Rowe noticed the &ldquo;too great sweetness in his manners.&rdquo;
       Thinking of his intimacy with Southampton on the one hand and Bardolph on
      the other, one is constrained to say of Shakespeare what Apemantus says of
      Timon:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The middle of humanity thou never knewest,
  But the extremity of both ends.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the extremes characters show themselves more clearly than they do in
      the middle classes; at both ends of society speech and deed are
      unrestrained. Falstaff and Bardolph and the rest were free of convention
      by being below it, just as Bassanio and Mercutio were free because they
      were above it, and made the rules. The young lord did what he pleased, and
      spoke his mind as plainly as the footpad. Life at both ends was the very
      school for quick, sympathetic Shakespeare. But even in early manhood, as
      soon as he came to himself and found his work, one other quality is as
      plain in Shakespeare as even his humour&mdash;high impartial intellect
      with sincere ethical judgement. He judges even Falstaff severely, to the
      point of harshness, indeed; as he judged himself later in Enobarbus. This
      high critical faculty pervades all his work. But it must not be thought
      that his conduct was as scrupulous as his principles, or his will as
      sovereign as his intelligence. That he was a loose-liver while in London
      is well attested. Contemporary anecdotes generally hit off a man's
      peculiarities, and the only anecdote of Shakespeare that is known to have
      been told about him in his lifetime illustrates this master trait of his
      character. Burbage, we are told, when playing Richard III., arranged with
      a lady in the audience to visit her after the performance. Shakespeare
      overheard the rendezvous, anticipated his fellow's visit, and met Burbage
      on his arrival with the jibe that &ldquo;William the Conqueror came before
      Richard III.&rdquo; The lightness is no doubt as characteristic of Shakespeare
      as the impudent humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another fact in Shakespeare's life which throws almost as much
      light on his character as his marriage. He seems to have come to riches
      very early and very easily. As we have seen, he was never able to paint a
      miser, which confirms Jonson's testimony that he was &ldquo;of an open and free
      nature.&rdquo; In 1597 he went down to Stratford and bought New Place, then in
      ruinous condition, but the chief house in the town, for £60; he spent at
      least as much more between 1597 and 1599 in rebuilding the house and
      stocking the barns with grain. In 1602 we find that he purchased from
      William and John Combe, of Stratford, a hundred and seven acres of arable
      land near the town, for which he paid £320; in 1605, too, he bought for
      £440 a moiety of the tithes of Stratford for an unexpired term of
      thirty-one years, which investment seems to have brought him in little
      except a wearisome lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, how did the poet obtain this thousand pounds or so? English
      apologists naturally assume that he was a &ldquo;good business man&rdquo;; with
      delicious unconscious irony they one and all picture the man who hated
      tradesmen as himself a sort of thrifty tradesman-soul&mdash;a master of
      practical life who looked after the pennies from the beginning. These
      commentators all treat Shakespeare as the Hebrews treated God; they make
      him in their own likeness. In Shakespeare's case this practice leads to
      absurdity. Let us take the strongest advocate of the accepted view.
      Dryasdust is at pains to prove that Shakespeare's emoluments, even as an
      actor in the '90's, were not likely to have fallen below a hundred a year;
      but even Dryasdust admits that his large earnings came after 1599, from
      his shares in the Globe Theatre, and is inclined &ldquo;to accept the tradition
      that Shakespeare received from the Earl of Southampton a large gift of
      money.&rdquo; As Southampton came of age in 1595, he may well out of his riches
      have helped the man who had dedicated his poems to him with servile
      adulation. Moreover, the statement is put forward by Rowe, who is
      certainly more trustworthy than the general run of gossip-mongers, and his
      account of the matter proves that he did not accept the story with eager
      credulity, but as one compelled by authority. Here is what he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one story so singular in magnificence of this patron of
      Shakspeare that if I had not been assured that the story was handed down
      by Sir Wm. D'Avenant, who was probably very well acquainted with his
      affairs, I should not have ventured to insert that my lord Southampton, at
      one time, gave him a thousand pounds to enable him to go through with a
      purchase to which he heard he had a mind. A bounty very great, and very
      rare at any time, almost equal to that profuse generosity the present age
      has shown to French dancers and Italian Eunuchs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems to me a great deal more likely that this munificent gift of
      Southampton was the source of Shakespeare's wealth than that he added coin
      to coin in saving, careful fashion. It may be said at once that all the
      evidence we have is in favour of Shakespeare's extravagance, and against
      his thrift. As we have seen, when studying &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice,&rdquo; the
      presumption is that he looked upon saving with contempt, and was himself
      freehanded to a fault. The Rev. John Ward, who was Vicar of Stratford from
      1648 to 1679, tells us &ldquo;that he spent at the rate of a thousand a year, as
      I have heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to deny that Shakespeare got rid of a great deal of money
      even after his retirement to Stratford; and men accustomed to save are not
      likely to become prodigal in old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th March, 1613, Shakespeare bought a house in Blackfriars for
      £140; the next day he executed another deed, now in the British Museum,
      which stipulated that £60 of the purchase-money was to remain on mortgage
      until the following Michaelmas; the money was unpaid at Shakespeare's
      death, which seems to me to argue a certain carelessness, to say the least
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dryasdust makes out that Shakespeare, in the years from 1600 to 1612, was
      earning about six hundred a year in the money of the period, or nearly
      five thousand a year of our money, and yet he was unable or unwilling to
      pay off a paltry £60.
    </p>
    <p>
      After passing the last five years of his life in village Stratford, where
      he could not possibly have found many opportunities of extravagance, he
      was only able to leave a little more than one year's income. He willed New
      Place to his elder daughter, Susanna Hall, together with the land, barns,
      and gardens at and near Stratford (except the tenement in Chapel Lane),
      and the house in Blackfriars, London, all together equal, at the most, to
      five or six hundred pounds; and to his younger daughter, Judith, he
      bequeathed the tenement in Chapel Lane, £150 in money, and another £150 to
      be paid if she was alive three years after the date of the will. Nine
      hundred pounds, or so, of the money of the period, would cover all he
      possessed at death. When we consider these things, it becomes plain, I
      think, that Shakespeare was extravagant to lavishness even in cautious
      age. While in London he no doubt earned and was given large sums of money;
      but he was free-handed and careless, and died far poorer than one would
      have expected from an ordinarily thrifty man. The loose-liver is usually a
      spendthrift.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are worse faults to be laid to his account than lechery and
      extravagance. Every one who has read his works with any care must admit
      that Shakespeare was a snob of the purest English water. Aristocratic
      tastes were natural to him; inherent, indeed, in the delicate
      sensitiveness of his beauty-loving temperament; but he desired the outward
      and visible signs of gentility as much as any podgy millionaire of our
      time, and stooped as low to get them as man could stoop. In 1596, his
      young son, Hamnet, died at Stratford, and was buried on 11th August in the
      parish church. This event called Shakespeare back to his village, and
      while he was there he most probably paid his father's debts, and certainly
      tried to acquire for himself and his successors the position of
      gentlefolk. He induced his father to make application to the College of
      Heralds for a coat of arms, on the ground not only that his father was a
      man of substance, but that he had also married into a &ldquo;worshipful&rdquo; family.
      The draft grant of arms was not executed at the time. It may have been
      that the father's pecuniary position became known to the College, or
      perhaps the profession of the son created difficulties; but in any case
      nothing was done for some time. In 1597, however, the Earl of Essex became
      Earl Marshal and Chief of the Heralds' College, and the scholar and
      antiquary, William Camden, joined the College as Clarenceux King of Arms.
      Shakespeare must have been known to the Earl of Essex, who was an intimate
      friend of the Earl of Southampton; he was indeed almost certainly a friend
      and admirer of Essex. The Shakespeares' second application to be admitted
      to the status of gentlefolk took a new form. They asserted roundly that
      the coat as set out in the draft of 1596 had been assigned to John
      Shakespeare while he was bailiff, and the heralds were asked to give him a
      &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; of it. At the same time John Shakespeare asked for
      permission to quarter on his &ldquo;ancient coat of arms&rdquo; that of the Ardens of
      Wilmscote, his wife's family. But this was going too far, even for a
      friend of Essex. To grant such a request might have got the College into
      trouble with the influential Warwickshire family of Arden, and so it was
      refused; but the grant was &ldquo;recognized,&rdquo; and Shakespeare's peculiar
      ambition was satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every single incident in his life bears out what we have learned from his
      works. In all his writings he praises lords and gentlemen, and runs down
      the citizens and common people, and in his life he spent some years, a
      good deal of trouble, and many impudent lies in getting for his father a
      grant of arms and recognition as a gentleman&mdash;a very pitiful
      ambition, but peculiarly English. Shakespeare, one fancies, was a
      gentleman by nature, and a good deal more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his snobbishness had other worse results. Partly because of it he
      never got to know the middle classes in England. True, even in his time
      they were excessively Puritanical, which quality hedged them off, so to
      speak, from the playwright-poet. With his usual gentleness or timidity,
      Shakespeare never tells us directly what he thought of the Puritans, but
      his half-averted, contemptuous glance at them in passing, is very
      significant. Angelo, the would-be Puritan ruler, was a &ldquo;false seemer,&rdquo;
       Malvolio was a &ldquo;chough.&rdquo; The peculiar virtues of the English middle class,
      its courage and sheepishness; its good conduct and respect for duties; its
      religious sense and cocksure narrow-mindedness, held no attraction for
      Shakespeare, and, armoured in snobbishness, he utterly missed what a
      knowledge of the middle classes might have given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take one instance of his loss. Though he lived in an age of
      fanaticism, he never drew a fanatic or reformer, never conceived a man as
      swimming against the stream of his time. He had but a vague conception of
      the few spirits in each age who lead humanity to new and higher ideals; he
      could not understand a Christ or a Mahomet, and it seems as if he took but
      small interest in Jeanne d'Arc, the noblest being that came within the ken
      of his art. For even if we admit that he did not write the first part of
      &ldquo;Henry VI.,&rdquo; it is certain that it passed through his hands, and that in
      his youth, at any rate, he saw nothing to correct in that vile and stupid
      libel on the greatest of women. Even the English fanatic escaped his
      intelligence; his Jack Cade, as I have already noticed, is a wretched
      caricature; no Cade moves his fellows save by appealing to the best in
      them, to their sense of justice, or what they take for justice. The Cade
      who will wheedle men for his own gross ambitions may make a few dupes, but
      not thousands of devoted followers. These elementary truths Shakespeare
      never understood. Yet how much greater he would have been had he
      understood them; had he studied even one Puritan lovingly and depicted him
      sympathetically. For the fanatic is one of the hinges which swing the door
      of the modern world. Shakespeare's &ldquo;universal sympathy&rdquo;&mdash;to quote
      Coleridge&mdash;did not include the plainly-clad tub-thumper who dared to
      accuse him to his face of serving the Babylonish Whore. Shakespeare
      sneered at the Puritan instead of studying him; with the result that he
      belongs rather to the Renaissance than to the modern world, in spite even
      of his Hamlet. The best of a Wordsworth or a Turgenief is outside him; he
      would never have understood a Marianna or a Bazarof, and the noble faith
      of the sonnet to &ldquo;Toussaint l'Ouverture&rdquo; was quite beyond him. He could
      never have written:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              &ldquo;Thou hast left behind
  Powers that will work for thee, air, earth and skies;
  There's not a breathing of the common wind
  That will forget thee; thou hast great allies;
  Thy friends are exultations, agonies,
  And love, and man's unconquerable mind.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is time to speak of him frankly; he was gentle, and witty; gay, and
      sweet-mannered, very studious, too, and fair of mind; but at the same time
      he was weak in body and irresolute, hasty and wordy, and took habitually
      the easiest way out of difficulties; he was ill-endowed in the virile
      virtues and virile vices. When he showed arrogance it was always of
      intellect and not of character; he was a parasite by nature. But none of
      these faults would have brought him to ruin; he was snared again in full
      manhood by his master-quality, his overpowering sensuality, and thrown in
      the mire.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. SHAKESPEARE'S LIFE&mdash;continued
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's life seems to fall sharply into two halves. Till he met
      Mistress Fitton, about 1597, he must have been happy and well content, I
      think, in spite of his deep underlying melancholy. According to my
      reckoning he had been in London about ten years, and no man has ever done
      so much in the time and been so successful even as the world counts
      success. He had not only written the early poems and the early plays, but
      in the last three or four years half-a-dozen masterpieces: &ldquo;A Midsummer's
      Night's Dream,&rdquo; &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Richard II.,&rdquo; &ldquo;King John,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
      Merchant of Venice,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Two Parts of Henry IV.&rdquo; At thirty-three he was
      already the greatest poet and dramatist of whom Time holds any record.
    </p>
    <p>
      Southampton's bounty had given him ease, and allowed him to discharge his
      father's debts, and place his dearly loved mother in a position of comfort
      in the best house in Stratford.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had troops of friends, we may be sure, for there was no gentler, gayer,
      kindlier creature in all London, and he set store by friendship. Ten years
      before he had neither money, place, nor position; now he had all these,
      and was known even at Court. The Queen had been kind to him. He ended the
      epilogue to the &ldquo;Second Part of Henry IV.,&rdquo; which he had just finished, by
      kneeling &ldquo;to pray for the Queen.&rdquo; Essex or Southampton had no doubt
      brought his work to Elizabeth's notice: she had approved his &ldquo;Falstaff&rdquo;
       and encouraged him to continue. Of all his successes, this royal
      recognition was surely the one which pleased him most. He was at the
      topmost height of happy hours when he met the woman who was to change the
      world for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lives of great men the typical tragedies are likely to repeat
      themselves. Socrates was condemned to drain many a poisoned cup before he
      was given the bowl of hemlock: Shakespeare had come to grief with many
      women before he fell with Mary Fitton. It was his ungovernable sensuality
      which drove him in youth to his untimely and unhappy marriage; it was his
      ungovernable sensuality, too, which in his maturity led him to worship
      Mary Fitton, and threw him into those twelve years of bondage to earthy,
      coarse service which he regretted so bitterly when the passion-fever had
      burned itself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can easily guess how he came to know the self-willed and wild-living
      maid-of-honour. Like many of the courtiers, Mistress Fitton affected the
      society of the players. Kemp, the clown of his company, knew her, and
      dedicated a book to her rather familiarly. I have always thought that
      Shakespeare resented Kemp's intimacy with Mistress Fitton, for when Hamlet
      advises the players to prevent the clown from gagging, he adds, with a
      snarl of personal spite:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mary Fitton's position, her proud, dark beauty, her daring of speech and
      deed took Shakespeare by storm. She was his complement in every failing;
      her strength matched his weakness; her resolution his hesitation, her
      boldness his timidity; besides, she was of rank and place, and out of pure
      snobbery he felt himself her inferior. He forgot that humble worship was
      not the way to win a high-spirited girl. He loved her so abjectly that he
      lost her; and it was undoubtedly his overpowering sensuality and
      snobbishness which brought him to his knees, and his love to ruin. He
      could not even keep her after winning her; desire blinded him. He would
      not see that Mary Fitton was not a wanton through mere lust. As soon as
      her fancy was touched she gave herself; but she was true to the new lover
      for the time. We know that she bore a son to Pembroke and two illegitimate
      daughters to Sir Richard Leveson. Her slips with these men wounded
      Shakespeare's vanity, and he persisted in underrating her. Let us probe to
      the root of the secret sore. Here is a page of &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida,&rdquo; a
      page from that terrible fourth scene of the fourth act, when Troilus,
      having to part from Cressida, warns her against the Greeks and their
      proficience in the arts of love:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Troilus</i>.      I cannot sing
  Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
  Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,
  To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
  But I can tell thee in each grace of these
  There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
  That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.

  <i>Cressida.</i> Do you think I will?

  <i>Troilus. No: but something may be done that we will not.</i>&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The first lines show that poor Shakespeare often felt out of it at Court.
      The suggestion, I have put in italics, is unspeakable. Shakespeare made
      use of every sensual bait in hope of winning his love, liming himself and
      not the woman. His vanity was so inordinate that instead of saying to
      himself, &ldquo;it's natural that a high-born girl of nineteen should prefer a
      great lord of her own age to a poor poet of thirty-four&rdquo;: he strives to
      persuade himself and us that Mary Fitton was won away from him by &ldquo;subtle
      games,&rdquo; and in his rage of wounded vanity he wrote that tremendous libel
      on her, which he put in the mouth of Ulysses:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      &ldquo;Fie, fie upon her!
  There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
  Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
  At every joint and motive of her body.
  O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
  That give accosting welcome ere it comes,
  And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
  To every ticklish reader! set them down
  For sluttish spoils of opportunity
  And daughters of the game.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      His tortured sensuality caricatures her: that &ldquo;ticklish reader&rdquo; reveals
      him. Mary Fitton was finer than his portraits; we want her soul, and do
      not get it even in Cleopatra. It was the consciousness of his own age and
      physical inferiority that drove him to jealous denigration of his
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Fitton did not beguile Shakespeare to &ldquo;the very heart of loss,&rdquo; as he
      cried; but to the innermost shrine of the temple of Fame. It was his
      absolute abandonment to passion which made Shakespeare the supreme poet.
      If it had not been for his excessive sensuality, and his mad passion for
      his &ldquo;gipsy,&rdquo; we should never have had from him &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Othello,&rdquo; &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lear.&rdquo; He would still have been a
      poet and a dramatic writer of the first rank; but he would not have stood
      alone above all others: he would not have been Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      His passion for Mary Fitton lasted some twelve years. Again and again he
      lived golden hours with her like those Cleopatra boasted of and regretted.
      Life is wasted quickly in such orgasms of passion; lust whipped to madness
      by jealousy. Mary Fitton was the only woman Shakespeare ever loved, or at
      least, the only woman he loved with such intensity as to influence his
      art. She was Rosaline, Cressid, Cleopatra, and the &ldquo;dark lady&rdquo; of the
      sonnets. All his other women are parts of her or reflections of her, as
      all his heroes are sides of Hamlet, or reflections of him. Portia is the
      first full-length sketch of Mary Fitton, taken at a distance: Beatrice and
      Rosalind are mere reflections of her high spirits, her aristocratic pride
      and charm: her strength and resolution are incarnate in Lady Macbeth.
      Ophelia, Desdemona, Cordelia, are but abstract longings for purity and
      constancy called into life by his mistress's faithlessness and passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare admired Mary Fitton as intensely as he desired her, yet he
      could not be faithful to her for the dozen years his passion lasted. Love
      and her soft hours drew him irresistibly again and again: he was the ready
      spoil of opportunity. Here is one instance: it was his custom, Aubrey
      tells us, to visit Stratford every year, probably every summer: on his way
      he was accustomed to put up at an inn in Oxford, kept by John D'Avenant.
      Mrs. D'Avenant, we are told, was &ldquo;a very beautiful woman, and of a very
      good witt and of conversation extremely agreeable.&rdquo; No doubt Shakespeare
      made up to her from the first. Her second son, William, who afterwards
      became the celebrated playwright, was born in March, 1605, and according
      to a tradition long current in Oxford, Shakespeare was his father. In
      later life Sir William D'Avenant himself was &ldquo;contented enough to be
      thought his (Shakespeare's) son.&rdquo; There is every reason to accept the
      story as it has been handed down. Shakespeare, as Troilus, brags of his
      constancy; talks of himself as &ldquo;plain and true&rdquo;; but it was all boasting:
      from eighteen to forty-five he was as inconstant as the wind, and gave
      himself to all the &ldquo;subtle games&rdquo; of love with absolute abandonment, till
      his health broke under the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In several of the Sonnets, notably in 36 and 37, Shakespeare tells us that
      he was &ldquo;poor and despised ... made lame by fortune's dearest spite.&rdquo; He
      will not even have his friend's name coupled with his for fear lest his
      &ldquo;bewailed guilt&rdquo; should do him shame:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Let me confess that we two must be twain,
  Although our undivided loves are one:
  So shall those blots that do with me remain
  Without thy help, by me be borne alone....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Spalding and other critics believe that this &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; of Shakespeare refers
      to his profession as an actor, but that stain should not have prevented
      Lord Herbert from honouring him with &ldquo;public kindness.&rdquo; It is clear, I
      think, from the words themselves, that the guilt refers to the fact that
      both Herbert and he were in love with the same woman. Jonson, as we have
      seen, had poked fun at their connection, and this is how Shakespeare tries
      to take the sting out of the sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare had many of the weaknesses of the neurotic and artistic
      temperament, but he had assuredly the noblest virtues of it: he was true
      to his friends, and more than generous to their merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      If his ethical conscience was faulty, his aesthetical conscience was of
      the very highest. Whenever we find him in close relations with his
      contemporaries we are struck with his kindness and high impartial
      intelligence. Were they his rivals, he found the perfect word for their
      merits and shortcomings. How can one better praise Chapman than by talking
      of
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The proud full sail of his great verse&rdquo;?
</pre>
    <p>
      How can one touch his defect more lightly than by hinting that his
      learning needed feathers to lift it from the ground? And if Shakespeare
      was fair even to his rivals, his friends could always reckon on his
      goodwill and his unwearied service. All his fine qualities came out when
      as an elder he met churlish Ben Jonson. Jonson did not influence him as
      much as Marlowe had influenced him; but these were the two greatest of
      living men with whom he was brought into close contact, and his relations
      with Jonson show him as in a glass. Rowe has a characteristic story which
      must not be forgotten:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;His acquaintance with Ben Jonson began with a remarkable
  piece of humanity and good-nature; Mr. Jonson,
  who was at that time altogether unknown, had offered
  one of his playes to the Players, in order to have it
  acted; but the persons into whose hands it was put, after
  having turned it carelessly and superciliously over, were
  just upon returning it to him, with an ill-natured answer,
  that it would be of no service to their company, when
  Shakespeare luckily cast his eye upon it, and found something
  so well in it as to encourage him to read through
  and afterwards to recommend Ben Jonson and his writings
  to the publick. After this they were professed
  friends; though I don't know whether the other ever
  made him an equal return of gentleness and sincerity.
  Ben was naturally proud and indolent, and in the days
  of his reputation did so far take upon him the premier
  in witt that he could not but look with an evil eye upon
  anyone that seemed to stand in competition with him.
  And if at times he has affected to commend him, it has
  always been with some reserve, insinuating his incorrectness,
  a careless manner of writing and a want of judgment;
  the praise of seldom altering or blotting out what
  he writt which was given him by the players over the first
  publish of his works after his death was what Jonson
  could not bear....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The story reads exactly like the story of Goethe and Schiller. It was
      Schiller who held aloof and was full of fault-finding criticism: it was
      Goethe who made all the advances and did all the kindnesses. It was Goethe
      who obtained for Schiller that place as professor of history at Jena which
      gave Schiller the leisure needed for his dramatic work. It is always the
      greater who gives and forgives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe, of course, too, in the traditional account of the unforgettable
      evenings at the Mermaid. &ldquo;Many were the wit-combats,&rdquo; wrote Fuller of
      Shakespeare in his &ldquo;Worthies&rdquo; (1662), &ldquo;betwixt him and Ben Jonson, which
      too I behold like a Spanish great galleon and an English man of war.
      Master Jonson (like the former) was built far higher in learning, solid
      but slow in his performances. Shakespeare, with the English man-of-war,
      lesser in bulk, but lighter in sailing, could turn with all sides, tack
      about, and take advantage of all winds by the quickness of his wit and
      invention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was natural for the onlooker to compare Ben Jonson and his &ldquo;mountainous
      belly&rdquo; to some Spanish galleon, and Shakespeare, with his quicker wit, to
      the more active English ship. It was Jonson's great size&mdash;a quality
      which has always been too highly esteemed in England&mdash;his domineering
      temper and desperate personal courage that induced the gossip to even him
      with Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beaumont described these meetings, too, in his poetical letter to his
      friend Jonson:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                   &ldquo;What things have we seen
  Done at the Mermaid? Heard words that have been
  So nimble and so full of subtle flame,
  As if that every one from whence they came
  Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest,
  And had resolved to live a fool the rest
  Of his dull life.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In one respect at least the two men were antitheses. Jonson was
      exceedingly combative and quarrelsome, and seems to have taken a chief
      part in all the bitter disputes of his time between actors and men of
      letters. He killed one actor in a duel and attacked Marston and Dekker in
      &ldquo;The Poetaster&rdquo;; they replied to him in the &ldquo;Satiromastix.&rdquo; More than once
      he criticized Shakespeare's writings; more than once jibed at Shakespeare,
      unfairly trying to wound him; but Shakespeare would not retort. It is to
      Jonson's credit that though he found fault with Shakespeare's &ldquo;Julius
      Caesar&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pericles,&rdquo; he yet wrote of him in the &ldquo;Poetaster&rdquo; as a
      peacemaker, and, under the name of Virgil, honoured him as the greatest
      master of poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradition gives us one witty story about the relations between the pair
      which seems to me extraordinarily characteristic. Shakespeare was
      godfather to one of Ben's children, and after the christening, being in a
      deep study, Jonson came to cheer him up, and asked him why he was so
      melancholy. &ldquo;No, faith, Ben,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;not I, but I have been considering
      a great while what should be the fittest gift for me to bestow upon my
      godchild and I have resolved at last.&rdquo; &ldquo;I pr'ythee, what?&rdquo; sayes he.
      &ldquo;I'faith, Ben, I'll e'en give him a dozen good Lattin spoons, and thou
      shalt translate them.&rdquo; Lattin, as everybody knows, was a mixed metal
      resembling brass: the play upon words and sly fun poked at Jonson's
      scholarship are in Shakespeare's best manner. The story must be regarded
      as Shakespeare's answer to Jonson's sneer that he had &ldquo;little Latine and
      lesse Greeke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the mist of tradition and more or less uncertain references in his
      poetry, one sees that he had come, probably through Southampton, to admire
      Essex, and the fall and execution of Essex had an immense effect upon him.
      It is certain, I think, that the noble speech on mercy put into Portia's
      mouth in &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice,&rdquo; was primarily an appeal to Elizabeth
      for Essex or for Southampton. It is plainly addressed to the Queen, and
      not to a Jew pariah:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                &ldquo;... It becomes
  The throned monarch better than his crown;
  His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
  The attribute to awe and majesty,
  Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
  But mercy is above this scepter'd sway,
  It is enthroned in the heart of kings.
  It is an attribute of God Himself,
  And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
  When Mercy seasons Justice.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All this must have seemed the veriest irony when addressed to an outcast
      Jew. It was clearly intended as an appeal to Elizabeth, and shows how far
      gentle Shakespeare would venture in defence of a friend. Like a woman, he
      gained a certain courage through his affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel convinced that he resented the condemnation of Essex and the
      imprisonment of Southampton very bitterly, for though he had praised
      Elizabeth in his salad days again and again, talked about her in &ldquo;A
      Midsummer Night's Dream&rdquo; as a &ldquo;fair vestal throned by the west&rdquo;; walking
      in &ldquo;maiden meditation, fancy-free&rdquo;; yet, when she died, he could not be
      induced to write one word about her. His silence was noticed, and Chettle
      challenged him to write in praise of the dead sovereign, because she had
      been kind to him; but he would not: he had come to realise the harsh
      nature of Elizabeth, and he detested her ruthless cruelties. Like a woman,
      he found it difficult to forgive one who had injured those he loved. Now
      that I have discussed at some length Shakespeare's character, its powers
      and its weaknesses, let us for a moment consider his intellect. All sorts
      and conditions of men talk of it in superlatives; but that does not help
      us much. It is as easy to sit in Shakespeare's brain and think from there,
      as it is from Balzac's. If we have read Shakespeare rightly, his
      intelligence was peculiarly self-centred; he was wise mainly through
      self-knowledge, and not, as is commonly supposed, through knowledge of
      others and observation; he was assuredly anything but worldly-wise. Take
      one little point. In nearly every play he discovers an intense love of
      music and of flowers; but he never tells you anything about the music he
      loves, and he only mentions a dozen flowers in all his works. True, he
      finds exquisite phrases for his favourites; but he only seems to have
      noticed or known the commonest. His knowledge of birds and beasts is
      similarly limited. But when Bacon praises flowers he shows at once the
      naturalist's gift of observation; he mentions hundreds of different kinds,
      enumerating them month by month; in April alone he names as many as
      Shakespeare has mentioned in all his writings. He used his eyes to study
      things outside himself, and memory to recall them; but Shakespeare's eyes
      were turned inward; he knew little of the world outside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's knowledge of men and women has been overrated. With all his
      sensuality he only knew one woman, Mary Fitton, though he knew her in
      every mood, and only one man, himself, profoundly apprehended in every
      accident and moment of growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not construct plays or invent stories, though he selected good
      ones with considerable certainty. He often enriched the characters, seldom
      or never the incidents; even the characters he creates are usually sides
      of himself, or humorous masks without a soul. He must have heard of the
      statesman Burleigh often enough; but nowhere does he portray him; no hint
      in his works of Drake, or Raleigh, or Elizabeth, or Sidney. He has no care
      either for novelties; he never mentions forks or even tobacco or potatoes.
      A student by nature if ever there was one, all intent, as he tells us, on
      bettering his mind, he passes through Oxford a hundred times and never
      even mentions the schools: Oxford men had disgusted him with their <i>alma
      mater</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The utmost reach of this self-student is extraordinary; the main puzzle of
      life is hidden from us as from him; but his word on it is deeper than any
      of ours, though we have had three centuries in which to climb above him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      &ldquo;Men must abide
  Their going hence even as their coming hither.
  Ripeness is all.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And if it be said that the men of the Renaissance occupied themselves more
      with such questions than we do, and therefore show better in relation to
      them, let us take another phrase which has always seemed to me of
      extraordinary insight. Antony has beaten Caesar, and returns to Cleopatra,
      who greets him with the astounding words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      &ldquo;Lord of lords,
  O, infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from
  The world's great snare uncaught?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This is all more or less appropriate in the mouth of Cleopatra; but it is
      to me Shakespeare's own comment on life; he is conscious of his failure;
      he has said to himself: &ldquo;if I, Shakespeare, have failed, it is because
      every one fails; life's handicap searches out every weakness; to go
      through life as a conqueror would require 'infinite virtue.'&rdquo; This is
      perhaps the furthest throw of Shakespeare's thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his worldly wisdom is to seek. After he had been betrayed by Lord
      Herbert he raves of man's ingratitude, in play after play. Of course men
      are ungrateful; it is only the rarest and noblest natures who can feel
      thankful for help without any injury to vanity. The majority of men love
      their inferiors, those whom they help; to give flatters self-esteem; but
      they hate their superiors, and lend to the word &ldquo;patron&rdquo; an intolerable
      smirk of condescension. Shakespeare should have understood that at thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his vanity was injured, his blindness was almost inconceivable. He
      should have seen Mary Fitton as she was and given us a deathless-true
      portrait of her; but the noble side of her, the soul-side a lover should
      have cherished, is not even suggested. He deserved to lose her, seeking
      only the common, careless of the &ldquo;silent, silver lights&rdquo; she could have
      shown him. He was just as blind with his wife; she had been unwillingly
      the ladder to his advancement; he should have forgiven her on that ground,
      if not on a higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was inordinately vain and self-centred. He talked incontinently, as he
      himself assures us, and as Ben Jonson complains. He was exceedingly quick
      and witty and impatient. His language shows his speed of thought; again
      and again the images tumble over each other, and the mere music of his
      verse is breathlessly rapid, just as the movement of Tennyson's verse is
      extremely slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once in his works I have shown how, at the crisis of fate, he
      jumps to conclusions like a woman. He seems often to have realized the
      faults of his own haste. His Othello says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;How poor are they that have not patience.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      With this speed of thought and wealth of language and of wit, he naturally
      loved to show off in conversation; but as he wished to get on and make a
      figure in the world, he should have talked less and encouraged his patrons
      to show off. Poor heedless, witty, charming Shakespeare! One threat which
      he used again and again, discovers all his world-blindness to me. Gravely,
      in sonnet 140, he warns Mary Fitton that she had better not provoke him or
      he will write the truth about her&mdash;just as if the maid of honour who
      could bear bastard after bastard, while living at court, cared one straw
      what poor Shakespeare might say or write or sing of her. And Hamlet runs
      to the same weapon: he praises the players to Polonius as
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Brief chronicles of the time; after your death you
  were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while
  you live.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is all untrue; actors were then, as now, only mummers without
      judgement. Shakespeare was thinking of himself, the dramatist-poet, who
      was indeed a chronicle of the time; but the courtier Lord Polonius would
      not care a dam for a rhymester's praise or blame. Posthumus, too, will
      write against the wantons he dislikes. Shakespeare's weapon of offence was
      his pen; but though he threatened, he seldom used it maliciously; he was
      indeed a &ldquo;harmless opposite,&rdquo; too full of the milk of human kindness to do
      injury to any man. But these instances of misapprehension in the simple
      things of life, show us that gentle Shakespeare is no trustworthy guide
      through this rough all-hating world. The time has now come for me to
      consider how Shakespeare was treated by the men of his own time, and how
      this treatment affected his character. The commentators, of course, all
      present him as walking through life as a sort of uncrowned king, fêted and
      reverenced on all sides during his residence in London, and in the
      fullness of years and honours retiring to Stratford to live out the
      remainder of his days in the bosom of his family as &ldquo;a prosperous country
      gentleman,&rdquo; to use Dowden's unhappy phrase. As I have already shown, his
      works give the lie to this flattering fiction, which in all parts is of
      course absolutely incredible. It is your Tennyson, who is of his time and
      in perfect sympathy with it; Tennyson, with his May Queens, prig heroes
      and syrupy creed, who passes through life as a conqueror, and after death
      is borne in state to rest in the great Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shakespeares, not being of an age, but for all time, have another
      guess sort of reception. From the moment young Will came to London, he was
      treated as an upstart, without gentle birth or college training: to Greene
      he was &ldquo;Maister of Artes in Neither University.&rdquo; He won through, and did
      his work; but he never could take root in life; his children perished out
      of the land. He was in high company on sufferance. On the stage he met the
      highest, Essex, Pembroke, Southampton, on terms of equality; but at court
      he stood among the menials and was despitefully treated. Let no one
      misunderstand me: I should delight in painting the other picture if there
      were any truth in it: I should have joyed in showing how the English
      aristocracy for this once threw off their senseless pride and hailed the
      greatest of men at least as an equal. Frederic the Great would have done
      this, for he put Voltaire at his own table, and told his astonished
      chamberlains that &ldquo;privileged spirits rank with sovereigns.&rdquo; Such wisdom
      was altogether above the English aristocracy of that or any time. Yet they
      might have risen above the common in this one instance. For Shakespeare
      had not only supreme genius to commend him, but all the graces of manner,
      all the sweetness of disposition, all the exquisite courtesies of speech
      that go to ensure social success. His imperial intelligence, however, was
      too heavy a handicap. Men resent superiority at all times, and there is
      nothing your aristocrat so much dislikes as intellectual superiority, and
      especially intellect that is not hall-marked and accredited: the
      Southamptons and the Pembrokes must have found Shakespeare's insight and
      impartiality intolerable. It was Ben Jonson whom Pembroke made Poet
      Laureate; it was Chapman the learned, and not Shakespeare, who was
      regarded with reverence. How could these gentlemen appreciate Shakespeare
      when it was his &ldquo;Venus and Adonis&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Lucrece&rdquo; that they chiefly
      admired. &ldquo;Venus and Adonis&rdquo; went through seven editions in Shakespeare's
      lifetime, while &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; was not thought worthy of type till the author
      had been dead six years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But badly as the aristocrats treated Shakespeare they yet treated him
      better than any other class. The shopkeepers in England are infinitely
      further removed from art or poetry than the nobles; now as in the time of
      Elizabeth they care infinitely more for beef and beer and broadcloth than
      for any spiritual enjoyment; while the masses of the people prefer a
      dog-fight to any masterpiece in art or letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some will say that Shakespeare was perhaps condemned for dissolute living,
      and did not come to honour because of his shortcomings in character. Such
      a judgement misapprehends life altogether. Had Shakespeare's character
      been as high as his intellect he would not have been left contemptuously
      on one side; he would have been hated and persecuted, pilloried or thrown
      into prison as Bunyan was. It was his dissolute life that commended him to
      the liking of the loose-living Pembroke and Essex. Pembroke, we know from
      Clarendon, was &ldquo;immoderately given to women.&rdquo; Four maids of honour, we
      learn, were <i>enceintes</i> to Essex at the same time. Shakespeare was
      hardly as dissolute as his noble patrons. The truth was they could not
      understand his genius; they had no measure wherewith to measure it, for no
      one can see above his own head; and so they treated him with much the same
      condescending familiarity that nobles nowadays show to a tenor or a ballet
      dancer. In March, 1604, after he had written &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo;
       Shakespeare and some other actors walked from the Tower of London to
      Westminster in the procession which accompanied King James on his formal
      entry into London. Each of the actors received four and a half yards of
      scarlet cloth to wear as a cloak on the occasion. The scarlet cloak to
      Shakespeare must have been a sort of Nessus' shirt, or crown of thorns&mdash;the
      livery of derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare, who measured both enemies and friends fairly, measured
      himself fairly, too. He usually praises his impersonations: Hamlet is &ldquo;a
      noble heart,&rdquo; Brutus &ldquo;the noblest Roman of them all&rdquo;; and speaking
      directly he said of himself in a sonnet:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I am that I am, and they that level
  At my abuses reckon up their own;
  I may be straight though they themselves be bevel.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He knew his own greatness, none better, and as soon as he reached middle
      age and began to take stock of himself, he must have felt bitterly that
      he, the best mind in the world, had not brought it far in the ordinary
      estimation of men. No wonder he showed passionate sympathy with all those
      who had failed in life; he could identify himself with Brutus and Antony,
      and not with the Caesars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's view of England and of Englishmen was naturally affected by
      their treatment of him. He is continually spoken of as patriotic, and it
      is true that he started in youth with an almost lyrical love of country.
      His words in &ldquo;Richard II.&rdquo; are often quoted; but they were written before
      he had any experience or knowledge of men.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;<i>Gaunt</i>. This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  This happy breed of men, this little world;
  This precious stone set in the silver sea,
  Which serves it in the office of a wall,
  Or as a moat, defensive to a house,
  Against the envy of less happier lands;
  This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The apologists who rejoice in his patriotism never realize that
      Shakespeare did not hold the same opinions throughout his life; as he grew
      and developed, his opinions developed with him. In &ldquo;The Merchant of
      Venice&rdquo; we find that he has already come to saner vision; when Portia and
      Nerissa talk of the English suitor, Portia says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;You know I say nothing to him; for he understands
  not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor
  Italian; and you will come into the court and swear that
  I have a poor pennyworth in the Englishman. He is a
  proper man's picture; but, alas, who can converse with a
  dumb show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought
  his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet
  in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      What super-excellent criticism it all is; true, now as then, &ldquo;a proper
      man's picture but ... a dumb show.&rdquo; It proves conclusively that
      Shakespeare was able to see around and over the young English noble of his
      day. From this time on I find no praise of England or of Englishmen in any
      of his works, except &ldquo;Henry V.,&rdquo; which was manifestly written to catch
      applause on account of its jingoism. In his maturity Shakespeare saw his
      countrymen as they were, and mentioned them chiefly to blame their love of
      drinking. Imogen says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
  Are they not but in Britain?..........................prithee, think
  There's livers out of Britain.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Whoever reads &ldquo;Coriolanus&rdquo; carefully will see how Shakespeare loathed the
      common Englishman; there can be no doubt at all that he incorporated his
      dislike of him once for all in Caliban. The qualities he lends Caliban are
      all characteristic. Whoever will give him drink is to Caliban a god. The
      brutish creature would violate and degrade art without a scruple, and the
      soul of him is given in the phrase that if he got the chance he would
      people the world with Calibans. Sometimes one thinks that if Shakespeare
      were living to-day he would be inclined to say that his prediction had
      come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      One could have guessed without proof that in the course of his life
      Shakespeare, like Goethe, would rise above that parochial vanity which is
      so much belauded as patriotism. He was in love with the ideal and would
      not confine it to any country.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is little to tell of his life after he met Mary Fitton, or rather
      the history of his life afterwards is the history of his passion and
      jealousy and madness as he himself has told it in the great tragedies. He
      appears to have grown fat and scant of breath when he was about thirty-six
      or seven. In 1608 his mother died, and &ldquo;Coriolanus&rdquo; was written as a sort
      of monument to the memory of &ldquo;the noblest mother in the world.&rdquo; His
      intimacy with Mary Fitton lasted, I feel sure, up to his breakdown in 1608
      or thereabouts, and was probably the chief cause of his infirmity and
      untimely death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only remains for me now to say a word or two about the end of his life.
      Rowe says that &ldquo;the latter part of his life was spent as all men of good
      sense will that theirs may be, in ease, retirement, and the conversation
      of his friends. He had the good fortune to gather an estate equal to his
      occasion, and, in that, to his wish, and is said to have spent some years
      before his death at his native Stratford.&rdquo; Rowe, too, tells us that it is
      a story &ldquo;well remembered in that country, that he had a particular
      intimacy with Mr. Combe, an old gentleman noted thereabouts for his wealth
      and usury; it happened that in a pleasant conversation amongst their
      common friends Mr. Combe told Shakespeare, in a laughing manner, that he
      fancied he intended to write his epitaph, if he happened to outlive him;
      and since he did not know what might be said of him when he was dead, he
      desired it might be done immediately; upon which Shakespeare gave him
      these four verses:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ten in the Hundred lies here ingrav'd
  'Tis a Hundred to Ten his soul is not sav'd:
  If any Man ask, 'Who lies in this tomb,'
  Oh! ho! quoth the Devil, 'tis my John-a-Combe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But the sharpness of the Satyr is said to have stung the man so severely
      that he never forgave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have given all this because I want the reader to have the sources before
      him, and because the contempt of tradesman-gain and usury, even at the
      very end, is so characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears, too, from the Stratford records, and is therefore certain,
      that as early as the year 1614 a preacher was entertained at New Place&mdash;&ldquo;Item,
      one quart of sack, and one quart of claret wine, given to a preacher at
      the New Place, twenty pence.&rdquo; The Reverend John Ward, who was vicar of
      Stratford, in a manuscript memorandum book written in the year 1664,
      asserts that &ldquo;Shakespeare, Drayton and Ben Johnson had a merie meeting,
      and itt seems drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a feavour there
      contracted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare, as we have seen from &ldquo;The Tempest,&rdquo; retired to Stratford&mdash;&ldquo;where
      every third thought shall be my grave&rdquo;&mdash;in broken health and in a
      mood of despairing penitence. I do not suppose the mood lasted long; but
      the ill-health and persistent weakness explain to me as nothing else could
      his retirement to Stratford. It is incredible to me that Shakespeare
      should leave London at forty-seven or forty-eight years of age, in good
      health, and retire to Stratford to live as a &ldquo;prosperous country
      gentleman&rdquo;! What had Stratford to offer Shakespeare&mdash;village
      Stratford with a midden in the chief street and the charms of the village
      usurer's companionship tempered by the ministrations of a wandering
      tub-thumper?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is abundant evidence, even in &ldquo;The Winter's Tale&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo;
       to prove that the storm which wrecked Shakespeare's life had not blown
      itself out even when these last works were written in 1611-12; the
      jealousy of Leontes is as wild and sensual as the jealousy of Othello; the
      attitude of Posthumus towards women as bitter as anything to be found in
      &ldquo;Troilus and Cressida&rdquo;:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     &ldquo;Could I find out
  The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
  That tends to vice in man but I affirm
  It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,
  The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
  Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
  Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
  Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
  All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,
  Why, hers, in part or all, but rather all;
  For even to vice
  They are not constant, but are changing still
  One vice, but of a minute old, for one
  Not half so old as that.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The truth is, that the passions of lust and jealousy and rage had at
      length worn out Shakespeare's strength, and after trying in vain to win to
      serenity in &ldquo;The Tempest,&rdquo; he crept home to Stratford to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his native air, I imagine, his health gradually improved; but he was
      never strong enough to venture back to residence in London. He probably
      returned once or twice for a short visit, and during his absence his pious
      daughter, Mrs. Hall, entertained the wandering preacher in New Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Shakespeare grew stronger he no doubt talked with Combe, the usurer,
      for want of any one better.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable, too, that on one of his visits to London he took up
      Fletcher's &ldquo;Henry VIII.&rdquo; and wrote in some scenes for him and touched up
      others, or Fletcher may have visited him in Stratford and there have
      begged his help.
    </p>
    <p>
      His youngest daughter, Judith, was married early in 1616; it seems
      probable to me that this was the occasion of the visit of Jonson and
      Drayton to Stratford. No doubt Shakespeare was delighted to meet them,
      talked as few men ever talked before or since, and probably drank too much
      with those &ldquo;poor unhappy brains for drinking&rdquo; which his Cassius deplored.
      Thus fanned, the weak flame of his life wasted quickly and guttered out.
      It is all comprehensible enough, and more than likely, that the greatest
      man in the world, after the boredom of solitary years spent in Stratford,
      died through a merry meeting with his friends; in his joy and excitement
      he drank a glass or so of wine, which brought on a fever. It is all true,
      true to character, and pitiful beyond words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare to me is the perfect type of the artist, and the artist is
      gradually coming to his proper place in the world's esteem. In the
      introduction to one of his &ldquo;Lives,&rdquo; Plutarch apologizes for writing about
      a painter, a mere artist, instead of about some statesman or general, who
      would be a worthy object of ambition for a well-born youth. But since
      Plutarch's time our view of the relative merits of men has changed and
      developed: to-day we put the artist higher even than the saint. Indeed, it
      seems to us that the hero or statesman, or saint, only ranks in proportion
      to the artist-faculty he may possess. The winning of a battle is not
      enough to engage all our admiration; it must be won by an artist. In every
      department of life this faculty is beginning to be appreciated as the
      finest possession of humanity, and Shakespeare was an almost perfect
      example of the self-conscious artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      People talk as if his masterpieces were produced at haphazard or by
      unconscious fruition; but masterpieces are not brought forth in this
      happy-go-lucky fashion. They are of the sort that only come to flower with
      perfect tendance. Even if we did not know that Shakespeare corrected his
      finest verses again and again with critical care, we should have to assume
      it. But we know that he spared no pains to better his finer inspirations,
      and he has told us in a sonnet how anxiously he thought about his art and
      the art of his rivals:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope
  With what I most enjoy contented least.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He has all the qualities and all the shortcomings of the reflective,
      humane, sensuous artist temperament, intensified by the fact that he had
      not had the advantage of a middle-class training.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a dozen ways our Puritan discipline and the rubs and buffets one gets
      in this work-a-day world where money is more highly esteemed than birth or
      sainthood or genius, have brought us beyond Shakespeare in knowledge of
      men and things. The courage of the Puritan, his self-denial and
      self-control, have taught us invaluable lessons; Puritanism tempered
      character as steel is tempered with fire and ice, and the necessity of
      getting one's bread not as a parasite, but as a fighter, has had just as
      important results on character. Shakespeare is no longer an ideal to us;
      no single man can now fill our mental horizon; we can see around and above
      the greatest of the past: the overman of to-day is only on the next round
      of the ladder, and our children will smile at the fatuity of his conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if we can no longer worship Shakespeare, it is impossible not to
      honour him, impossible not to love him. All men&mdash;Spenser as well as
      Jonson&mdash;found him gentle and witty, gay and generous. He was always
      willing to touch up this man's play or write in an act for that one. He
      never said a bitter or cruel word about any man. Compare him with Dante or
      even with Goethe, and you shall find him vastly superior to either of them
      in loving kindness. He was more contemptuously treated in life than even
      Dante, and yet he never fell away to bitterness as Dante did: he
      complained, it is true; but he never allowed his fairness to be warped; he
      was of the noblest intellectual temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible not to honour him, for the truth is he had more virtue in
      him than any other son of man. &ldquo;By their fruits ye shall know them.&rdquo; He
      produced more masterpieces than any other writer, and the finest sayings
      in the world's literature are his. Think of it: Goethe was perfectly
      equipped; he had a magnificent mind and body and temperament: he was born
      in the better middle classes; he was well off; splendidly handsome;
      thoroughly educated; his genius was recognized on all hands when he was in
      his teens; and it was developed by travel and princely patronage. Yet what
      did Goethe do in proof of his advantages? &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; is the only play he ever
      wrote that can rank at all with a dozen of Shakespeare's. Poor Shakespeare
      brought it further in the sixteenth century than even Goethe at full
      strain could bring it in the nineteenth. I find Shakespeare of surpassing
      virtue. Cervantes ranks with the greatest because he created Don Quixote
      and Sancho Panza; but Hamlet and Falstaff are more significant figures,
      and take Hamlet and Falstaff away from Shakespeare's achievement, and more
      is left than any other poet ever produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvest after harvest Shakespeare brought forth of astounding quality. Yet
      he was never strong, and he died at fifty-two, and the last six years of
      his life were wasted with weakness and ill-health. No braver spirit has
      ever lived. After &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; and &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lear&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Timon&rdquo; he broke down: yet as soon as he struggled back to sanity, he came
      to the collar again and dug &ldquo;The Winter's Tale&rdquo; out of himself, and
      &ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo; and seeing they were not his best, took breath, and brought
      forth &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo;&mdash;another masterpiece, though written with a heart
      of lead and with the death-sweat dank on his forehead. Think of it; the
      noblest autumn fruit ever produced; all kindly-sweet and warm, bathed so
      to speak in love's golden sunshine; his last word to men:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The rarer action is
  In virtue than in vengeance....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then the master of many styles, including the simple, wins to a
      childlike simplicity, and touches the source of tears:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;We are such stuff as dreams are made of,
  And our little life is rounded with a sleep.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      True, Shakespeare was not the kind of man Englishmen are accustomed to
      admire. By a curious irony of fate Jesus was sent to the Jews, the most
      unworldly soul to the most material of peoples, and Shakespeare to
      Englishmen, the most gentle sensuous charmer to a masculine, rude race. It
      may be well for us to learn what infinite virtue lay in that frail,
      sensual singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dumb struggling world, all in travail between Thought and Being,
      longs above everything to realize itself and become articulate, and never
      has it found such width of understanding, such melody of speech, as in
      this Shakespeare. &ldquo;I have often said, and will often repeat,&rdquo; writes
      Goethe, &ldquo;that the final cause and consummation of all natural and human
      activity is dramatic poetry.&rdquo; Englishmen do not appear yet to understand
      what arrogance and what profound wisdom there is in this saying; but in a
      dull, half-conscious way they are beginning dimly to realize that the
      biggest thing they have done in the world yet is to produce Shakespeare.
      When I think of his paltry education, his limiting circumstances, the
      scanty appreciation of his contemporaries, his indifferent health, and
      recall his stupendous achievement, I am fain to apply to him, as most
      appropriate, the words he gave to his <i>alter ego</i>, Antony, Antony
      who, like himself, was world-worn and passion-weary:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    &ldquo;A rarer spirit never
  Did steer humanity; but you, gods, will give us
  Some faults to make us men.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      THE END.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
